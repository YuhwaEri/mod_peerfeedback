We are committed to keeping our employees healthy and happy. We are committed to helping all employees have a successful career and retirement. We will need four quarters of improved metrics in order to provide employees with a 401K. The leadership team is still determining what level of improvement we will need in order to guarantee a 401K.

In review of our 2019 YTD\r\nfinancials, RTD has spent 1.5% of our sales on warranty expense.&nbsp; This\r\namounts to $3.0m of cost we can re-coup through a service-plan offering.\r\n&nbsp;If we plan on a 100% markup of our warranty cost ($6.0m) that we would\r\ncharge back to our customers, we could drop $3.6m to our bottom line assuming a\r\n60% contribution margin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to your direction questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n <li>We\r\n     believe a service plan offering in 2020 is the right strategy to maintain\r\n     and enhance our margins in 2020 and beyond.&nbsp; The impact to our bottom\r\n     line is substantial and that would enable us to continue to innovate our\r\n     product offerings. </li>\r\n <li>A\r\n     critical aspect of the service program is that RTD will generate a new\r\n     revenue stream that will offset our after-hour service operation that can\r\n     provide $3.6m in increased profitability to re-invest in the business in\r\n     2020 and beyond.</li>\r\n <li>The\r\n     risks of doing service is that we will be passing-through our costs to our\r\n     customers, which could impact our McCoy and McCoy Max revenue and customer\r\n     satisfaction.&nbsp; What we can do to mitigate that risk is provide tiered\r\n     offering to lessen the cost impact to customers that might not want the\r\n     highest coverage.&nbsp; We will also be able to lock in customers for\r\n     multi-year service contracts which will help us plan revenues and our\r\n     service operations next year and beyond.</li>\r\n <li>RTD\r\n     management believes we should open up our service offering to our\r\n     competitor’s products for two reasons.&nbsp; The first is to gain intel on\r\n     our competitors defect/repair issues that we can in turn use to our\r\n     advantage as we enhance our products and develop new ones.&nbsp; The\r\n     second is to showcase our attention to quality and the customer as a\r\n     competitive conversion tool.&nbsp; We know that as soon as our\r\n     competitor’s customers experience RTD’s customer first mentality, they\r\n     will be inclined to do business with us in the future.</li>\r\n <li>Additional\r\n     opportunities we are thinking of to enhance the customer experience\r\n     include on-site service repairs for anything that falls within our lowest\r\n     tiered offering.&nbsp;

As of Q1 2019, we have introduced New Sensors, enabling the\r\ndoctor’s to get more data expediting the results and treatment program for\r\ntheir patients. A shorter cycle time, together with more data contributes to the\r\nefficiency and with that your contribution margin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Q2 2019, ABC came to the market with new Data Encryption,\r\nin full compliance with the new HIPAA standards. Protecting the data of your\r\ncustomers doesn’t directly contribute to profitability, but limits the exposure\r\nof any potential loss of data. Imagine this data getting into the wrong hands\r\nand how this could potentially hurt both our organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of Q3 2019, we will have faster DPC processor’s installed in\r\nour product range, resulting in quicker results and actually impacting your\r\nefficiency indicator L.O.S. (length of stay). Your LOS will drop significantly\r\nand that will allow your professionals treat more people, resulting in more\r\nprofitability. That’s a true Win-Win!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue to develop our products and on average are spending\r\naround 8% on R&amp;D and heavily on the Quality performance, to further enhance\r\nour products. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you might have any questions, please do not hesitate to\r\ngive me call or schedule a meeting. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kind regards</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arjan Veenstra<br>\r\nChief Commercial Officer <br>\r\nAdvanced Bioengineering Concepts ®</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>For Quality products, please contact our sales team at\r\nsales@abc.com or +1 555 223 34 455.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<i>About\r\nus:<br>\r\n</i>ABC\r\nis one of the leading producers of the Real McCoy and is active since 2017.&nbsp;Visit\r\nus www.abc.com<br></p>',1),(796,1625,12752,'<p><b>MEA bid for 3Q: $21\'000 at 5.25 six-sigma measured</b></p><p>Best regards</p>',1),(797,1623,12767,'<p><ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n <li>What are the appropriate question to ask</li>\r\n <ol start=\"1\" type=\"a\">\r\n  <li>Is the TRNH financial statement deviation from Benford’s Law pure statistical or are there any possibilities of fraudulent\r\n      information?</li>\r\n  <li>How to go about further investigation without loosing\r\n      10% of our sales, but still protecting our financial position?</li>\r\n </ol>\r\n <li>Next steps</li>\r\n <ol start=\"1\" type=\"a\">\r\n  <li>Talk to the customer about accounting concern\r\n      our audit team has discovered</li>\r\n  <li>We’d\r\n      like to apply Benford’s law to previous quarters\r\n      (for TRNH) – last five years</li>\r\n  <li>Depending on the results:</li>\r\n </ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<!--[endif]-->Majority of the\r\nquarter not complying with the Benford’s law:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\" type=\"1\">\r\n <ol start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\r\n  <ol start=\"1\" type=\"i\">\r\n   <ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>We’d\r\n        ask external auditors for independent analysis (Big 4)</li>\r\n    <ol start=\"1\" type=\"a\">\r\n     <li>Risk analysis of losing the customer (sales\r\n         of 10% of the market) – financially non-qualified\r\n         customer</li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    <li>To be on a safe side, we’d try to change payment terms (upfront payment)</li>\r\n   </ol>\r\n  </ol>\r\n </ol>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<!--[endif]-->Majority of the\r\nquarter complying with the Benford’s law:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\" type=\"1\">\r\n <ol start=\"3\" type=\"a\">\r\n  <ol start=\"2\" type=\"i\">\r\n   <ol start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n    <li>Payment terms negotiation</li>\r\n    <li>Tight control of actual payments</li>\r\n    <li>No further sales before existing payables are fulfilled</li>\r\n   </ol>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <li>Stay alert, risk analysis, accounts payable control,\r\n      follow the news, alerts on the company</li>\r\n </ol>\r\n</ol><br></p>',1),(798,1624,12741,'<p>Here my friends we can see the beneficial fruits pf our common work relation ship <br /></p>',1),(799,1625,12785,'<p>Price: $20700</p><p>Quality: sigma 5,65</p>',1),(800,1623,12744,'<p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Since the results of the analysis is an indication and not a fact, we would focus further gathering more data and identify potential risk and red flags not to affect the public relationship and not to disrupt the customer.</span></p><p><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">We would ask the following questions to&nbsp;<u>further estimate the potential financial exposure</u>&nbsp;on the TRHN customer:</span></b></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">1) What is the audit opinion on their financial statements in the last 3 years?</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">2) How do the TRHN financial results compare with their competitor’s in the industry? &nbsp;Can we see any deviations, red flags, potential issues?

I understand your concerns and share your opinions on this issue. I believe the biggest problems is the miscommunication between the employees and the IT. Next time there is a new technology implemented, every employee needs to get an email notification explaining what is being implemented,&nbsp; how they can get help and 3 different training sessions organized by IT that they can participate in where we will demo these tools. I will personally make sure that our help desk will be aware of every single implementation and change moving forward. I believe that the digital transformation is crucial and will endlessly support the addition of new tools such as the use of RPA and&nbsp;Tableau Software. Education of RPA will cost around&nbsp; $10,000&nbsp; and would be about a 3 month commitment for training.&nbsp; Costs may seem high to you but the return will be quick and substantial. We can discuss this in detail on the meeting I will be setting up and I will prepare a cost/benefit analysis for decision-making purposes.

Spam is inundating the internet with many copies of the same message in an attempt to force the message on people who would otherwise not choose to receive it. A spam filter separates unsolicited emails from those that are legitimate, placing the unsolicited messages in a separate folder. There is always the risk that the filter may block messages that are legitimate, so it is essential to review the messages in the spam folder from time to time. Most spam filters permit you to specify which emails you want to receive in your inbox based on a list of email addresses that you specify, often called a \"white list\".<br><br>For more information about anti-spam and email antivirus, see our <a href=\"http://www.corpcomputerservices.com/services/mailsecurity\"><u>CorporateMail Security</u></a> page.<br><br></li><li><b>Anti-Spyware Technology</b><br>Spyware, as defined by CRMtech.com, is \"any technology that aids in gathering information about a person or organization without their knowledge.

As currently the contribution margins are very high for DES, we believe that this could be a highly profitable venture for our company to go into. Also, as the market gets more populated with Hamada and other companies, we could use this revenue stream to maintain competitiveness and industry presence. It would also be a more streamlined approach that would improve customer satisfaction, seeing as rather than having to reach out to a 3rd party to have their issues resolved, they can go straight to the manufacturer to back the product in a likely more timely manner. Risks for this implementation include hiring additional labor or allocating people to support this warranty, as well as developing a process for this. Another key risk would include capacity constraints/margin constraints; as we are paying for 3% of units (no matter if this is exceeded) to DES. If we have more than 3% of units being sent back then we would be questionable for profit margin on this warranty process. To mitigate these risks, we believe a strategy analysis and more field data is required. If we could track how many warrantied products were repaired, then we could make an executive decision on whether the program would have a business case of being implemented. Key success factors include long term planning/financial strategy, as well as having highly trained operators for this. Likely a lab would need to be installed around one of these sites to handle this as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',1),(1151,2022,17607,'<p><h5><span lang=\"EN\">To:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gustav Gashford<h5></h5><h5><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shop Superintendent</span></h5></span></h5><h5></h5><h5><span lang=\"EN\">From:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IT Manager</span></h5><h5></h5><h5><span lang=\"EN\">Subject: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Virtual Reality and Shop Floor Training</span></h5><br></p><p>Hi Gustav,</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to me for this opportunity.

In order to achieve this, the\r\nstrategy of the company is built around four pillars: </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><ol><li><p><b>Customer\r\nPrice Sensitivity:</b> Ensure a customer sensitive pricing of our product so\r\nthat we can win in the market based on a price advantage.</p></li><li><p><b>Product\r\nEnhancement:</b> Consistently invest in our product to offer improved and\r\nenhanced features to our customer. This will help promote customer loyalty and\r\nenthusiasm towards our product. </p></li><li><p><b>Planning\r\nand Cost Efficiencies:</b> Invest in operational efficiency and pass on\r\nbenefits of related cost reductions to the customer in form of a reduced\r\nselling price.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p><b>Market\r\nBased Product Differentiation</b>: Invest in projects (Eg: Project 3) that help\r\nus gain a first mover advantage in the market. </p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>2) How did the\r\ndecisions that you and your team made for Q3 and Q4 2019 support your strategy?\r\n</b></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>In Q3 and Q4, my team mates and I made the following\r\ndecisions that were in sync with our strategy: </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><ol><li><p>In order to remain price sensitive, we continued\r\nselling our product at $590 which is lower compared to our competitors. This\r\nhelped us increase units sold from 679 in Q2 to 1094 in Q3, FY19. </p></li><li><p>&nbsp;In order\r\nto ensure product differentiation, our company was the only one to invest in\r\nProject 3 which increases our potential market by 50% extending the use of the\r\nreader to other hospital departments like: housekeeping, maintenance and\r\ndietary controls. </p></li></ol><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>3) Were the decisions\r\nsuccessful, and how would you measure that success? </b></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>Our decisions were partially successful. The decision to\r\nkeep price constant helped us sell more and maintain a constant market share. However,\r\nthe downside was that we did not generate enough cash and breached our credit\r\nline by $3000. We are now re-working our pricing strategy to ensure we don’t\r\nend up in a similar situation next quarter. </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>In addition to this, from our cash position one can see that\r\nwe are the only company to invest in Project 3. Although there have been some\r\ntechnical delays, once Project 3 is implemented, we will have a first mover\r\nadvantage and see success in form of revenue and market share gains. </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>4) If you could “do\r\nit again”, what would you have done differently? </b></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>If we could re-work our strategy for Q3 and Q4’2019, we\r\nwould have invested more aggressively in marketing and advertising. From 2018-4\r\nto 2019-1, we invested 12K in operations efficiency and reduced the selling\r\npricing by 40 dollars which helped us gain around 100 more units. But at the\r\nsame time, we were also curious to see how sensitive our customers are towards\r\nother elements like marketing. To test that, from 2019-Q3 to 2019-Q4, we\r\nbrought down the investment in operations efficiency to normal, increased our\r\ninvestment in marketing by 40k while kept the price to normal. And ended up\r\nwith around 300 units more. We if we could “do it again” we would definitely\r\ninvest more in marketing to reap further benefits. </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>5) Has your team had\r\nto change tactics, given decisions that your competitors made? Why or why not?</b></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>Based on competitor behavior and their ability to capture\r\nmarket share, we made the decision to invest more heavily in Marketing. We\r\nincreased this investment by 121% from Q1 to Q4 FY19 in the hope of increasing\r\nour visibility in the market. </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>6) Is your strategy\r\nstill intact and valid? Why or why not?</b></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>While our goal of achieving 36% market share by the end of\r\nQ4 2020 remains the same, we have decided to re-visit our strategy and\r\nimplement a few changes, mentioned below: </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>In order to survive in Q1, we will maintain our\r\nprice-point.&nbsp; In Q2, we are going to\r\nimplement project 3. Shorten receivable terms, increase investment in marketing\r\nand advertising to create atmosphere for our new product. We should be having\r\nsome positive earnings by Q2. In Q3 to Q4, we will invest in quality\r\nengineering. With a positive market performance, we can explore other sources\r\nof funding. At the same time, we will make efforts to discover adjacent market\r\nopportunities and other R&amp;E initiatives for product differentiation. With\r\nthis, we can hope to end up with 36% market share by Q4 2020. </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p><b>B) Select any\r\nmanufacturer </b>with a strategy that appears similar to your company’s own\r\nstrategy (excluding Dell or Apple).

The company has established\r\nitself as the leader in the organic and natural food segment and has invested\r\nheavily in store quality and customer service. These factors differentiate it\r\nfrom other grocers, and they have fostered a relatively loyal customer base. The\r\nsustainability of Whole Foods\' competitive advantage is dependent, at least in\r\nthe short term, on its larger competitors\' unwillingness or inability to\r\naddress the organic market. (This is similar to the strategy adopted by our\r\ncompany to invest in Project 3 to target untapped hospital departments apart\r\nfrom just nurses).</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><b>Supply\r\nChain capabilities and associated cost efficiencies:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Whole Foods sources many of its\r\nperishable and specialty products from a web of suppliers at the cost of that makes\r\nthose particular products special for customers. The rest of Whole Foods products,\r\nnamely the bulk of its nonrefrigerated packaged goods, it obtains through a\r\ntraditional natural foods supply chain intermediary, United Natural Foods, Inc.\r\n(UNFI). With these supply chain capabilities, Whole Foods passes on the\r\nbenefits to the customer in form of a competitive customer price.

The mitigant would\r\nbe to provide enough actual and perceived value through Services.

Competitor’s products will bring in additional challenges if the\r\nquality is not maintained. Also, if the competitor gets into service business,\r\nwe will be competing with them on their products which is not a good strategy.\r\nMessaging should be – we stand behind our product as its high quality.

If the competitor doesn’t\r\nprovide similar services, it gives us a competitive advantage.<b></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>e) Anything else?&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategy is to provide basic\r\nrepair/warranty service to customer for 1 year included in the price. The\r\npremium services would be 24 hour support, turnaround time of 48 hours – those\r\nservices we monetize and provide in increments of 1 yr/ 2 yr/ 3 yr/5 yr\r\ncontracts so we can lock in the customer for multiple future years. This will\r\nprovide not only additional growth for us, but also cushion us in difficult\r\nmacro economic times when the short demand sometimes takes a hit.

Failing to do so will drastically put us behind our competition by putting us in the hole with debt, and therefore will not allow us to maintain positive financial performance in the future.</p><p>4. Metric: Sustain a minimum of a 20% OM. This will allow us to have free cash flow to increase business in the future and remain profitable to sustain operations.</p><p>5: Metric: Improve our inventory turnover by 5%. Would augment cash flow and ensure a consistent transfer of manufactured product out into the market. This would also show we have positive conversion in our company.</p>',1),(1961,2459,30085,'',1),(1962,2458,30133,'',1),(1963,2458,30132,'',1),(1964,2459,30093,'',1),(1965,2458,30135,'',1),(1966,2459,30070,'',1),(1967,2459,30084,'<p><b>Roles</b><br>Finance

It has significant potential to increase our margin overall. This is an excellent opportunity from&nbsp; a margin perspective but also an area where we can focus and prioritize improving our service quality. For that reason, service is something I recommend we pursue and continue to investigate.</p><p>The key success factors attributed to service would be from a cost perspective. If we are saving on margin from moving services in-house, we should make that change. The level of service quality would be important; since we would be handling requests in-house, we should be having less issues with service requests. The current level of service is a huge factor to consider. If the third party is charging us excessive margins, we can easily recoup our money while investing even more into our employees. A huge issue for us was employees not feeling like part of the team. Moving our services internally would alleviate that problem and signify a shift in leadership on bringing together our staff. That element cannot be understated.</p><p>Risks associated with moving our aftermarket service in-house revolve around making such a substantial change. The primary risk would be customer satisfaction and the overall response to our updated service. There is no guarantee that our customers respond positively to the new service. Also, we need to be able to staff enough employees to respond to the requests. A third party allowed us to avoid this issue, but it would be a burden for us to carry. We also need additional training and the careful transition of work between businesses. The separation of a partnership is difficult, but the business case for this shift is strong.</p><p><br></p><p>Best,</p><p>Operations Manager</p>',1),(2230,3129,34721,'<p><p><u>Service Growth Opportunity:</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why We Should Pursue:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that adding service to our portfolio would\r\ngreatly increase our net income, and cash conversion as well as greatly cut\r\ndown on cost. If DES is making a 50% profit margin from our business than this\r\nis a serious and possibly unnecessary cost that we are incurring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently we are giving DES 3% of our sales plus a one-time\r\n150K fee for servicing our scanners.

We are limited to hiring 5 people per quarter and need to ensure we\r\nhave the capacity to offer good warranty service. In order to mitigate this, we\r\nneed to ensure we have appropriate infrastructure to support this task. One way\r\nwe can mitigate this is by hiring unpaid college students as interns. They can\r\nbe our customer service representatives and can be the first level of contact.\r\nWe can create a relationship with a nearby University to start a relationship\r\nfor this new program.

I have heard that there is some consideration\r\nbeing given to buying a new line of automated equipment that will replace many\r\nof our quality assurance employees. My concern about this information relates\r\nto our previous conversations about the impact of personnel reductions. The\r\ndiscussions we have been through in the past year have focused on job security,\r\na key concern of your workforce. Even though you have committed to increase\r\nwages next year, and benefits are generally considered adequate, this will not\r\nguarantee harmony in our workforce if we begin replacing workers with machines.\r\nWe are already in an intensive machine industry with most of the workers\r\nallocated to quality assurance rather than production functions. Security and\r\njanitorial tasks have been outsourced. The ILMs require only one employee (this\r\nshould be two)! Now, if the QAAs are replaced, the only work left will be\r\nmachine shop, equipment maintenance, inventory, administration and shipping. We\r\ncannot allow this to happen! You should expect that automation will cause a\r\nconsiderable negative reaction among the workers, and I cannot predict the\r\nconsequences. If there is no basis for my concern, please reassure me as soon\r\nas possible.

Our team members are our greatest\r\nasset and as the General Manager I value the feedback you and the Employment\r\nCommittee provide. The value I place on this is reflected in several\r\nattachments which are outlined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m happy to report an update to our ongoing discussion around a\r\nproductivity bonus. As a results-driven company, our compensation approach tightly\r\nlinks our rewards with our results. Our Productivity Bonus Plan (PBP) is\r\ndesigned to reward team members for helping the factory meet or exceed its\r\npre-defined performance goals.&nbsp;The goals of the IBP are to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n <li>Align the bonus plan structure and metrics with current\r\n     business priorities.</li>\r\n <li>Provide individuals with a strong incentive to drive\r\n     performance and reward individual performance that drives company results\r\n     that benefits us all.</li>\r\n <li>Align all team members around key financial and\r\n     strategic initiatives that are crucial to long-term company success.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We are able to offer a productivity bonus when the factory\r\nachieves a net income of $6 million dollars. This will result in an individual\r\nbonus modifier of 8% as a percentage of base salary for all employees. We are\r\nlooking forward to being able to do this soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you also for raising the issue about the shirts. I have\r\ntalked to corporate and obtained shirts for all our employees. Thanks to your\r\nproactiveness we are the first factory to have shirts provided for all\r\nemployees and the management team and I were thrilled to pass them out today.\r\nWe look forward to getting our first Factory 3 photo with all team members in\r\nour new shirts this coming Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks again for your continued proactiveness in raising up\r\nissues and partnerships in driving improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meredith Melecki, General Manager and Factory 3 Management Team</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Attachments:</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christmas Party – The management team really enjoyed the party\r\nthe Employee Committee put on, thank you for organizing this.

As you are\r\naware, there is a shortage of skilled labor in our areas. To continue investing\r\nin our current workforce, upskilling our team members, and also support a\r\nbalance between work and family life we have developed a strategy to support\r\nadditional growth leveraging machinery that can increase our yield process\r\nwithout new hires. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of\r\nthis Machine Implementation Strategy is leasing (2) additional Universal\r\nElectronic Test Machines (UETMs) this quarter (2022Q1) that will be deployed\r\nand fully operating next quarter (2022Q2). While these machines cover the need for\r\nnew hires, we want to make sure that the employee environment is not affected,\r\nand all employees feel valued and appreciated. To reiterate, current employees\r\nwon’t be replaced by UETMs and we want this to be communicated thoroughly. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re\r\nlooking forward hearing your thoughts and ideas about this Employee\r\nSatisfaction Framework and review any implementation proposals from you. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Meredith\r\nMelecki</b><b></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>General\r\nManager</p><br>',1),(2642,3602,44773,'<p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"1020\">\r\n\r\n <colgroup><col width=\"278\">\r\n <col width=\"421\">\r\n <col width=\"216\">\r\n <col width=\"105\">\r\n </colgroup><tbody><tr height=\"19\">\r\n  <td height=\"19\" width=\"278\">Risk Mitigation and\r\n  Disaster Recovery Actions</td>\r\n  <td width=\"421\"></td>\r\n  <td width=\"216\"></td>\r\n  <td width=\"105\"></td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr height=\"19\">\r\n  <td height=\"19\">Risk</td>\r\n  <td>Action</td>\r\n  <td>Backup Process</td>\r\n  <td>Frequency</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr height=\"19\">\r\n  <td height=\"19\">Review\r\n  CyberSecurity</td>\r\n  <td>Cyber Security\r\n  Assessment</td>\r\n  <td>Firewall - Security\r\n  and Training</td>\r\n  <td>Daily</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr height=\"19\">\r\n  <td height=\"19\">Natural\r\n  Disasters</td>\r\n  <td>Assessment with\r\n  National Security Forecasting and anticipating impacts</td>\r\n  <td>Backup Server in\r\n  other location</td>\r\n  <td>Daily</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr height=\"19\">\r\n  <td height=\"19\">Rapid Digital\r\n  Transformation</td>\r\n  <td>Work with IT\r\n  Consulting Provider to Anticipate Digital Transformation</td>\r\n  <td>Strong Process and\r\n  Documentation</td>\r\n  <td>Every 2 Quarters</td>\r\n </tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody></table><br></p>',1),(2643,3601,44748,'<p></p><p>&nbsp;Proposal:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN\">Units:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;325</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><span lang=\"EN\">Entity\r\nName:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Company 5, Starship 5</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Sigma Quality at the end of Quarter 2022-2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5.25</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Bid Transfer Price per Unit*:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9 150 USD</b></p><br><p></p>',1),(2644,3602,44756,'<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p><p>Happy to share what actions and mitigation plans we have in place.

It will be held on&nbsp;Friday 12/19 after work and will have drinks,&nbsp;snacks,&nbsp;entertainment, and a small token of appreciation will be handed out!!!&nbsp;We plan to have Christmas off as well so the workers can have the holiday off to spend time with their family.&nbsp;In addition, the management team has vowed to&nbsp;see&nbsp;the factory once every&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;and I can guarantee you that we will keep that promise.&nbsp;This quarter we will come the day off the holiday party and next&nbsp;quarter,&nbsp;we will give a week’s notice to when we will come!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p><p paraid=\"492901097\" paraeid=\"{fa837a9d-c38a-4e58-8679-0ea3cf44b0e7}{161}\"><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><br></span></p><p paraid=\"492901097\" paraeid=\"{fa837a9d-c38a-4e58-8679-0ea3cf44b0e7}{161}\"><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">Thanks and let me know if you have any questions!</span></p></div><br></p>',1),(2850,3779,48371,'Entity Name: Factory #3<p>Bid Price: $9,700</p><p>Quality Level: 4.75 in 2021-Q3</p>',1),(2851,3779,48361,'<p><p>Hi Ardeshir Industries, Factory 1 is unable to make a bid for the current quarter.

I truly appreciate people like you who have the courage to speak up\r\nand seek solutions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In regard to all the frustration with the disconnect between\r\nworkers and management, the new team has tried to make diligent efforts to\r\nvisit the factory floor and get to know each of the factory workers. Our\r\nbusiness does not run without our hard-working factory workers and all they do.\r\nUpper management is planning to implement a new recognition program to help\r\nhighlight each of our workers and their commitment to the company. Workers can\r\nexpect this to be rolled out beginning middle of FY21Q4. We have also\r\nimplemented monthly town halls. The goal is to make our employees feel heard\r\nand though they have a platform and designated space to bring up frustrations.\r\nThe first of these meetings will be held in the coming week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the holidays are fast approaching, we are very excited to\r\naward factory workers with plentiful vacation time to spend with families. In addition\r\nto time off, we are hosting a company Christmas/Holiday party. All expenses\r\nwill be covered by the business. We hope the employees will come eat, drink,\r\nand be marry all together as a ManX collective. All factories and workers are\r\ninvited and can bring a guest. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As head of HR, I am truly sorry to hear any of our employees\r\nfeel frustrated and underappreciated.

We plan to order 2 UTEMs in Q1 2022, and then 4 UTEMs each in Q2, Q3, and Q4 of 2022. This intended forecast is contingent on our evaluation of the UTEM and the variance between quoted prices and actual lease cost. Currently we have very high hopes for the machine and anticipate its high performance, however there are a lot of unknowns and risks with this machine. We will need to evaluate how well the machine performs next quarter once we receive our first one. It will likely take us some time to accurately determine the ROI of the machine, so we will likely only order two more in the following quarter Q1 and hopefully at the end of that quarter, we will have a strong evaluation of the machine. If it performs as we hope, and is cost effective, we plan to order the maximum of 4 in the remaining quarters.&nbsp;</p>',1),(2854,3777,48389,'<p><p>Good afternoon Brian,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My sincere apologies that management has not made contact or\r\nbeen to the shop floor to visit the team.

In regards to the branded shirts - these are available to all staff. Unfortunately we had some supply issues with the delivery of these and we only received half the supply intended. The shirts planned for the hourly workers were made from a more durable material due to management feeling this would be necessary for the nature of factory work. These shirts happened to be those with supply issues. I have been told that these issues will be rectified and the ETA for supply is next week along with branded water and coffee mugs.&nbsp;</p><p>In relation to the Holiday party I am happy to share that this has now been booked.

To hopefully make this right in the eyes of the hourly personal,\r\nI have attached an order form for shirts. If you would kindly take this back to\r\nthe hourly employees and collect names &amp; shirt sizes – I will have a special\r\nshipment ordered right away! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as townhalls and company touch points go, I truly\r\nwant these meetings to feel like open and safe spaces for all employees to address\r\nconcerns/suggestions for the company!

something we want to invest in. Making our employee effectiveness increase for new employees 6-8% and existing employees 3-4% would help increase productivity for us and the employees would likely appreciate us investing in their training and development, increasing moral. Our QAAs would also perform better which would increase our quality as well, which positively influences customer satisfaction. If both options result in these same benefits, we would make our decision based off of pricing effectiveness. Thinking ahead we would likely choose option one, the V-Train as currently with our 69 employees, it would cost us $54,500 plus $500 for each additional employee we hire and put through the program in the next two years.

To mitigate this, we\r\nwill be using existing positive cash flows and lines of credit with our banking\r\npartners to finance our operations in the short terms before profits allow us\r\nto repay our debts. Additionally, the lack of experience in this sector would\r\nbe a huge risk. To mitigate this risk, we must seek our executive talent from\r\nother organizations specifying in the services we will provide. Lastly, a risk\r\nis not meeting our customers expectations immediately following the transition\r\nfrom our current partner. To mitigate this, we will need to have our employees\r\ntrained and reminded of customer service best practices. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please let us know if you have any questions regarding our\r\nthoughts on this matter.

A good measure of the customer satisfaction is the quality sigma score, which you can see in our metrics above, however, this is not fully inclusive. Percentage promises kept can be another key metrics to track to measure customer satisfaction. We have received data that this percentages promises kept metric is currently at 96%, however, some have suggested we have been inconsistent in our performance here. Allow us to pursue this one separately since it is not necessarily under your financial metrics buckets.</p><p>In terms of employee satisfaction, a combination of their effectiveness (QAA effectiveness) and number of quits.

We looked into different companies and decided that our best option is to partner with Dell Technologies as they provide one of the most effective services. The evaluation of selecting a company had wide variety in the criteria such as service offering, benefits, costs, and company values. After meeting with Dell, they offered their service package for $120,000 and ensured a full system update with a 5-year guarantee. Our team agreed that this would ensure quality IT software and efficiency throughout our system.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>',1),(3496,4867,62961,'<p><p>Factory 3 is concerned that we cannot fully capitalize on\r\nWCP benefits, new employees in factories and ILMs if our computers and\r\ntechnology are not up to date. Thus, we believe that given our limited cash on\r\nhand, we will work within the $90,000 budget to improve technology according to\r\nemployee technology needs. To reap the benefits of each WCP in terms of increase\r\nin sigma and QAA, we need to make sure these technology changes are implemented\r\nalmost immediately over the course of 3 quarters. This is to ensure we aren’t\r\nburning through our limited cash on hand immediately, but that we are investing\r\ninto these upgrades starting in FY22Q4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, we plan to spend $30k/quarter, effective FY22Q4, and\r\nlasting through FY23Q2. </p><br></p>',1),(3497,4866,62928,'<p><p><br></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gus-- hope all is well with you. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’re concerns regarding our employee’s satisfaction due to\r\nthe presence of UETMS is completely understood. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The management team is aligned with prioritizing and valuing\r\nour employees.

In the fear of hurting\r\nemployee morale, we would like toe avoid getting an UETM until necessary. We are\r\nalso avoiding investing in additional ILMs if possible.

This will also allow the factory workers individual time to meet the managers and voice any concerns they might have.</p><p>One way we\'d like to increase employee morale at the end of the year is to do small giveaways as incentives for good work.

We would like to have a potluck for the factory employees, with the main entree being supplied by our managers. Having employees bring in their favorite dishes to share will allow everyone to get to know each other better, and share their individual cultures. Also, a potluck will not be a great expense for our company and will boost morale.&nbsp;</p><p>We would also like to implement \"Inspire Awards\" for our employees. This is a system used by other notable companies, and it allows employees to recognize each other for their hard work.

Here, employees can voice any concerns or\r\nopinions that they feel need to be brought to the attention of management. If\r\nthere are concerns that need to be addressed from this meeting, management will\r\nbe sure to take action on these items. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the shirts, we will be sure to hand-deliver ManX company\r\nshirts to all hourly workers. In addition, we will throw in additional company\r\nhat to thank you for your patience in us getting these shirts delivered to you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, we would like to personally invite 5 of our\r\ntop-performing hourly workers to a dinner and cocktail party, along with going\r\nto “Hamilton” with Gabriel Varden. We think this would be a great way for\r\nemployees to meet with the supplier and have a great time outside of the workplace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also want to allocate $1,000 to an employee part, starting\r\nthis quarter (quarter 2) all the way through quarter 4. We think celebrating\r\nthe team’s accomplishments every quarter will boost morale and improve team\r\nculture and cooperation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We absolutely do not interpret any of your raised concerns\r\nare whining. We are appreciative of your honesty and want to ensure that we are\r\ntreating you, our dedicated hourly workforce, with the respect, inclusiveness,\r\nand treatment that you deserve. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that these action items and comments address your\r\nconcerns, and that we can improve the relationship between management and\r\nemployees moving forward.

Talking to our employees with honesty and truth is the only way\r\nout. The employee committee doesn’t like it because they are afraid their job\r\nwould be taken back because of these machines, and that is not going to happen.\r\nFirst of all, the ILM and UETM are pretty much identical tools, and they are\r\ngoing to perform as much of the same productivity as they are doing day-to-day\r\nnow. We have reviewed every single detail of the working process carefully; their\r\nfootprint and functions are almost the same. This is the thing that matters to\r\nour workers, so we are going to ease their anxiety and frustration. And we are\r\naware that the cost of the lease of the machines will be going up if we use\r\nthem on Saturday, so overtime is another essential topic. We can negotiate with\r\nour committee, and with our employees about overtime. The layoff is costly for\r\nus, and losing the workforce is harmful to us. So first things first are to\r\nschedule regular communication and be transparent to all of our workers. Apart\r\nfrom communication, we will increase productivity by bringing in these\r\nmachines, but instead of layoff, we will train all of our workers to use these\r\nmachines and make sure all of them are able to improve their skills and capability\r\nof using the machine for each individual. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each employee is our valuable\r\nasset, and this investment is worthy.

transformation. Although the goal is to achieve Factory 4.0, we will need to have a gradual implementation of new systems. At this time, we will need to reassess this project for next quarter. We understand the importance of updating these systems, and we have not underestimated the importance of this project. Please feel free to reach out with any other questions, concerns, or compromises on this project. A more budget-friendly number or gradual implementation plan would be beneficial to accepting this improvement.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\" xml:lang=\"EN-US\" lang=\"EN-US\"> </span><span

We are indeed disheartened to hear that our employees do not feel included. We understand employees feel there is an \"us\" versus \"them\" culture, but we do not tolerate this nor do we wish to promote it. We would just like to clarify that there was no \"big holiday party\" for management team and it is never our intention to exclude our employees. As for the company shirts, we were planning on extending these shirts to all employees free of cost. Management was only wearing the \"preliminary\" shirts before the company executives gave us the \"all clear\" to hand out to our hourly employees.</p><p>With the beginning of the fiscal year 2023, we have delivered on our 6% increase in hourly wages in recognition of the employees\' hard work thus far. The management team recognizes we cannot operate without the vital contribution of our employees. We have also reinstated and improved the performance review process to streamline communication between management and employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Management Team</p>',1),(3753,5078,68274,'<p>We would like to offer a bid price of $9,000 USD with a technical Quality Sigma score of 5.</p>',1),(3754,5077,68268,'<p><p>Hi Brianna,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always, I appreciate your candor in reaching out and\r\nsharing your insight.

Actually, we threw a holiday party for everyone last year – all\r\nemployees were welcome to join. Personally, I had a wonderful time celebrating\r\nthe holidays and the end of a very special year with the team, and I remember included\r\nsome hourly employees who were able to make it. Everyone should have received\r\nan invite – is it possible that some of them missed the email that was sent? We\r\ncan also put up some flyers in the break room next time. I would appreciate\r\nyour help in spreading the word and making sure that all employees are reminded\r\nof such events in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving the team members the opportunity to purchase company\r\nshirts is an excellent idea. Please let me know how many employees are\r\ninterested in a shirt, and I will pass that along to corporate to place the\r\norder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will also be implementing a suggestion box this quarter.\r\nEmployees are still encouraged to raise any items during our “all hands”\r\nmeetings, but this will be supplemental in case anyone would prefer to remain\r\nanonymous or to avoid airing their grievances in a public setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are incredibly appreciative of the team, and we hope that <i><u>our</u>\r\n</i>company’s culture continues to strengthen from this point onward.

From PWC, Employees in VR courses can be trained up to four times\r\nfaster and they are more confident in applying what they are taught. They are\r\nalso proven to be more focused. With this model, VR training can be a cost\r\neffective solution, especially if we decide to scale our operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opinions on vendors and pricing models:<br>\r\nFrom review of two vendors and pricing models, VR Solutions does stand out for\r\nme vs. V-Train. First of “as-a-service” provider means we will have less work\r\ninstalling and managing hardware and updates. We don’t want to be distracted\r\nfrom our main business by having to worry about updating and maintaining\r\ntraining programs with V Train. In addition, the costing model of VR solutions\r\nis more flexible and less costly up front as it is charged per quarter and at\r\n$150/QAA vs $500/employee for V Train. In addition, a lock in period of 24\r\nmonths is not bad as we can test out the quality and won’t have to commit with\r\na large up-front cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, VR Solutions looks more
