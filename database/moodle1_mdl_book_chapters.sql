Despite advances in breadth and complexity, the original foundation of accounting\r\nhas not greatly changed. &nbsp;Throughout the business world, entrepreneurs,\r\nmanagers, shareholders, employees, businesses, governmental entities, taxing\r\nauthorities, and non-profits alike, all require an\r\nefficient and standardized approach\r\nto understand a firm’s financial health.&nbsp;\r\nThis is where accounting comes in!&nbsp;\r\nFinancial accounting utilizes various tools and standards to measure,\r\nanalyze and report the most recent performance of any business entity.<br>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To standardize policies and procedures used to\r\ncreate a company’s financial statements, accounting and finance professionals\r\nutilize a common set of accounting principles.&nbsp;\r\nIn the US, these standards are known as GAAP - Generally Accepted\r\nAccounting Principles. US GAAP is utilized by varied entities – from publicly\r\ntraded and privately held companies to governments and non-profit\r\norganizations.&nbsp; US GAAP creates a standard\r\nframework by which business entities can be commonly measured against. The\r\nguidelines outlined in US GAAP allow businesses to consistently and clearly\r\nreport financial results, enabling investors to compare businesses and assess\r\nthe financial health of a business.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&lt;GAAP Graphic, bold text and letters&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although businesses often need to interpret US\r\nGAAP’s broad principles for application to specific transactions, they still must\r\nfollow the underlying standards and remain consistent in their application\r\nperiod to period. This consistency and transparency is important to shareholders,\r\ntaxing authorities, governments, business owners, and other parties who are\r\ninterested in determining the financial state of any firm based on a standard\r\nmethod of reporting. In the United States, the FASB (Financial Accounting\r\nStandards Board), a designated private sector organization sets US GAAP on\r\nauthority of the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) – an independent\r\nfederal agency responsible for maintaining orderly functioning of US securities\r\nmarkets and protecting investors against fraudulent business practices. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FASB maintains the Accounting Standards\r\nCodification (ASC) which is the single source of authoritative US GAAP for all\r\nnongovernmental entities in the US.&nbsp;\r\nEffective for accounting periods ending after 2009, ASC reorganized thousands\r\nof existing US GAAP pronouncements (from the FASB and EITF – Emerging Issues\r\nTask Force) into approximately 90 accounting topics.&nbsp; The standard structure ASC used for those 90\r\ntopics provided a more organized manner for communicating the accounting literature,\r\nallowing for easier research of accounting issues and reduced risk of\r\nnon-compliance due to improved usability of the information.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img width=\"641\" height=\"625\" class=\"img-responsive atto_image_button_left\" role=\"presentation\" alt=\"\" src=\"@@PLUGINFILE@@/Placeholder.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last decade, many countries have been\r\nmoving towards using an international set of standards called IFRS -\r\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards. The purpose of IFRS is to create a\r\nglobal standard for financial reporting and business transactions; in the U.S.,\r\nIFRS would essentially replace US GAAP. Although adoption of IFRS in the US has\r\nbeen slow, and US GAAP remains the standard, the FASB continues its work to\r\nalign US GAAP and IFRS, which will result in significant accounting changes for\r\nmany companies in the next several years.<a name=\"_30j0zll\"></a>&nbsp; Several differences between US GAAP and IFRS\r\noriginate from the idea that US GAAP is a rigid set of rules while IFRS is far\r\nmore judgment, or principles-based in regards to accounting decisions.&nbsp; Both, however, may require interpretation at\r\ntimes in order to apply basic guidelines to specific transactions.&nbsp; The methodology used to assess specific\r\naccounting treatment is considered, under US GAAP, to focus more on researching\r\nthe literature while IFRS focuses on more of a thorough review of the facts\r\npattern of the transaction. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><u>Some\r\nexamples of key differences between US GAAP and IFRS include:</u></i><i><u></u></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>■&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><b><i>Revenue Recognition:</i></b> US GAAP currently follows four basic\r\nrequirements that must be met in order for revenue to be realized or realizable\r\nand earned - namely, 1) Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2)\r\nDelivery has occurred or services rendered; 3) Price is fixed or determinable\r\nand 4) Collectability is reasonably assured.&nbsp;\r\nUnder ASC 606 and IFRS 15, the new revenue recognition standard will\r\nenlist a five step approach to depict the transfer of control of goods or\r\nservices to customers.

Why and what is the difference?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To illustrate the point, let’s first observe a\r\nclassic example of local commerce – the farmer’s market. In this case, cash\r\nchanges hands predominantly two ways. The first, as an expense, when the produce\r\n(fruits and vegetables) is purchased from a store, supplier, or farmer; second,\r\nas revenue, when a customer pays for his or her selection of fresh produce. A\r\ncash accounting system works quite efficiently for a small business scenario\r\nsuch as this. In this system, revenue/expenses are recognized only when cash is\r\ntransferred, making it the simplest form of accounting for a small business.</p><p><img src=\"@@PLUGINFILE@@/Placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"625\" role=\"presentation\" class=\"img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom\"><br></p><p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most large businesses, though, do not transact\r\nin cash; rather, they use what’s known as accrual accounting. With accrual\r\naccounting, revenues/expenses are recognized when the event occurs rather than\r\nwhen cash is exchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, when a business invoices a\r\ncustomer for payment related to the purchase of goods or services, the invoice\r\namount can then be recognized as revenue, provided other conditions have been\r\nmet, even though the customer has not yet made payment in cash. Conversely,\r\nwhen a bill is received, an expense can be recorded even if the supplier has\r\nnot been paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To better visualize the difference between\r\ncash and accrual accounting, imagine a company that sells a product in May but\r\ndoesn’t receive payment until August. With cash accounting, revenue isn’t\r\nrecognized until payment is actually received in August.&nbsp; With accrual accounting, revenue is\r\nrecognized in May assuming all other criteria are met, even though payment is\r\nnot received until August. The commitment made in May to pay, at the time of\r\nsale, is called accounts receivable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n <tbody><tr>\r\n  <td width=\"214\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"428\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p align=\"center\"><b><i>Timing of Revenue Recognition</i></b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"214\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"center\"><b><i>Cash Method</i></b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"214\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"center\"><b><i>Accrual Method</i></b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"214\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>Sale of Product or Service to a\r\n  Customer</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"214\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>In the period in which cash is\r\n  received from the customer</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"214\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>In the period in which the\r\n  company invoices the customer (provided all US GAAP conditions for rev rec\r\n  have been met)</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Revenue Recognition</i></b> is a complex principle that assists a\r\nbusiness with correctly recognizing revenue through an analysis of the revenue\r\ngeneration process, as well as application of very specific US GAAP rules.

If no\r\ncause-and-effect relationship exists between an expense and revenues (e.g.,\r\nrent on a building or lease payments on a copy machine), the expense will be\r\nrecognized when the cost has been used up or has expired. Under the matching\r\nprinciple, if a cost cannot be directly linked to revenues or to a specific\r\naccounting period, the cost is immediately recognized as an expense. Some\r\nexamples of this can be seen in advertising expense, or costs related to\r\nresearch and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea of cause-and-effect allows a company\r\nto reveal that they are not artificially inflating their value by recognizing\r\nrevenues early while pushing expenses to a later date.

For example, though the contra account, Accumulated Depreciation, is\r\n  an asset account, an increase would be a credit and a decrease would be a\r\n  debit. The accumulated depreciation account is opposite of its related asset\r\n  account, PP&amp;E (Property, Plant, and Equipment). The net of these two\r\n  accounts gives a clearer picture of the valuation of property, plant, and\r\n  equipment on the balance sheet over time. Another contra asset account is\r\n  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts; its related asset account is Accounts\r\n  Receivable. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts is used when a company enters\r\n  estimated amounts for uncollectible accounts — a debit to Bad Debt Expense\r\n  and a credit (increase) to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. The net of the\r\n  two related asset accounts (Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful\r\n  Accounts) shows the expected accounts receivable a company is likely to\r\n  collect.

Amortization is similar to depreciation and is used for intangible\r\nassets, because it also helps tie the cost of definite-lived intangible assets (e.g.\r\npatents) with the revenues they generate.

Gross margin is calculated by\r\ntaking total revenues and subtracting cost of goods sold. The result reflects\r\nthe sales revenue remaining after incurring the costs directly associated with\r\nproducing the goods and services sold during the current accounting\r\nperiod.&nbsp; In short, it’s the revenue that\r\nremains to pay for all other operating costs and obligations of the\r\ncompany.&nbsp; Often companies will report and\r\nanalyze Gross Margin as a percentage of sales, or Gross Margin% - calculated\r\nsimply as Gross Margin $/Revenue $.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gross\r\nMargin% is often a key metric for companies and helps drive analysis of\r\nperformance as well as forecast future actions required to increase\r\nprofitability.&nbsp; For example, if a\r\ncompany\'s gross margin is small or falling, the firm may look to change its\r\nprocesses to lower manufacturing costs or find suppliers who offer lower costs\r\non production materials. Alternatively, the company may decide to increase\r\nprices to boost revenue to improve the gross margin. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some\r\ncompanies also include a line item in their income statement for Operating\r\nMargin, sometimes referred to as Operating Profit and, for some companies,\r\nequivalent to an EBIT calculation (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes).\r\nOperating margin takes a company\'s gross margin, and then subtracts all\r\noperating expenses and depreciation. A business\'s operating expenses are costs\r\nincurred from operating activities and include items such as office salaries,\r\nsupplies, depreciation and amortization. Operating income excludes items such\r\nas investments in other firms, taxes, interest expenses, and nonrecurring items\r\nsuch as cash paid for a lawsuit settlement. Operating Margin is also often\r\nreported as a percentage of sales, or Operating Margin% - calculated simply as\r\nOperating Margin $/Revenue $.&nbsp; Here’s an\r\nexample of Gross Margin and Operating Margin:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n <tbody><tr>\r\n  <td width=\"254\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"172\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"357\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>Revenues&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"69\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">$60,000</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"357\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>Cost of\r\n  revenues</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"69\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><u>(25,000)</u></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"357\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Gross\r\n  Margin</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"69\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><b>$35,000</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><b>58.3%</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"357\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>Selling,\r\n  general, and administrative expenses&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  </p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"69\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">(5,000)</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"357\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>Depreciation\r\n  and amortization&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"69\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">(4,000)</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"357\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>Restructuring\r\n  charges&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"69\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><u>(3,000)</u></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><u>&nbsp;</u></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"357\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating Income</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"69\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><b>$23,000</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><b>38.3%</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"357\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"69\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"82\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <!--[if !supportMisalignedColumns]-->\r\n <tr height=\"0\">\r\n  <td width=\"317\"></td>\r\n  <td width=\"130\"></td>\r\n  <td width=\"86\"></td>\r\n  <td width=\"103\"></td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <!--[endif]-->\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another indicator of a company’s financial performance is\r\nEBITDA.&nbsp; It is the equivalent of adding\r\ndepreciation and amortization back to the EBIT calculation mentioned\r\nabove.&nbsp; In other words, it represents\r\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization have been\r\nsubtracted on the income statement.&nbsp;\r\nEBITDA is a means to evaluate a firm’s operating performance without\r\nhaving to factor in the impact of financing decisions, accounting decisions or\r\nthe taxing environment.&nbsp; This allows\r\ninvestors to compare profitability across companies and industries.&nbsp; Some companies measure EBITDA performance\r\ninternally and externally through EBITDA targets.</p><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1519435782,''),(21,3,3,0,'The Balance Sheet','<p><p>The <b>balance sheet</b>, also called the\nstatement of financial position, summarizes a company\'s assets, liabilities and\nshareholders\' equity at a specific point in time. Whereas the balance sheet\nprovides a “snapshot in time,” an income statement and a statement of cash\nflows present an institution’s financial condition over a specific period of\ntime. The three balance sheet segments give investors an idea as to what the\ncompany owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by shareholders. </p>\n\n<p>Assets may\ninclude cash, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, property, and other assets\nthat a company physically or legally owns. Liabilities are the amounts that a\ncompany owes to outside parties. Examples include payments needed for suppliers,\nrent, utilities, salaries, and to pay down debt. Equity, often referred to as stockholders’\nequity or owners’ equity, is the amount of net investment attributable to the business\'\nowners, or stockholders. It shows what portion of the assets are financed not\nby debt, but rather capital contributed by the owners along with the cumulative\nimpact of earnings generated by company operations. Equity may be referred to\nas the “book value of a company.” You can calculate equity on a balance sheet\nby subtracting total liabilities from total assets. It is important to note\nthat the “book value of a company” represents the cumulative effect of the\ninvested capital and the total lifetime retained earnings of a firm less paid\ndividends. The “book value of a company” does not represent the market value of\nthe company, which is the total value of stock traded (in the case of public\ncompanies) and can be significantly higher than the book value.</p>\n\n<p>The balance\nsheet gets its name from the underlying premise that assets = liabilities + equity\n(the accounting equation).

Like the income\r\nstatement, the cash flow statement focuses on a\r\nspecific period of time. However, as we know, net income is not the same as\r\ncash flow because of timing differences between accounting for certain items\r\nper GAAP and the actual receipt or disbursement of cash.&nbsp; Because\r\nthe income statement is prepared under the accrual basis of accounting, the\r\ncash related to revenues reported may not have been collected. Similarly, the\r\ncash related to expenses reported on the income statement might not have been\r\npaid as of the reporting date. It is important to remember, though, that cash\r\nis just as important to the success of a company as profitability. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although a company may appear\r\nfinancially healthy from an income statement perspective, flags may be raised\r\nif the company is not able to effectively generate cash. For example, a company\r\ncan show an increase in net profit, quarter over quarter, due to rising\r\nrevenues; however, if the company has an even greater increase in accounts\r\nreceivable, indicating it is not collecting cash in a timely manner from\r\ncustomers, at some point in the future the company may not have the cash flow\r\nneeded to pay its suppliers, employee salaries, or invest in new equipment. If\r\nthis pattern continues, it can lead to potential long-term operational issues\r\nfor an otherwise profitable company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing\r\nboth cash flow and profitability are critical to a company’s success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cash flow statement consists of three\r\nsections: cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from investing\r\nactivities, and cash flow from financing activities. There are actually two\r\nways to calculate cash flow from operating activities: the direct and indirect\r\nmethod. It is important to understand that both methods result in the same “Net\r\nCash Provided by Operating Activities” amount. Whichever method is used, the\r\nstructure stays the same for the remaining two cash flow sections: cash flow\r\nfrom financing activities and cash flow from investing activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;

The calculation of cash flow from operating activities begins\r\nwith net income, followed by a process where adjustments are made to reconcile<b> </b>net income to net cash provided by\r\noperating activities. Due to the fact that not all transactions for a business\r\nare cash-based, these changes in accrual line-items must be recorded to build a\r\nfunctioning statement of cash flows. Another key adjustment to net income is\r\nthe “adding back” of the current period’s depreciation and amortization\r\nexpenses. Remember, these are non-cash items included in the bottom line of a\r\ncompany’s income statement but which have no impact on cash flow. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changes in non-cash balance sheet accounts\r\nhave an impact on cash flow. These can include: trade receivables, prepaid\r\nexpenses, inventory, other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued\r\nliabilities. In order to understand whether the balance change in a particular\r\naccount causes an increase or decrease in cash flow, consider whether the\r\nchange in the given balance sheet account exhibits collection of cash or\r\ndisbursement of cash. For example, an increase in accounts receivable period\r\nover period means that less cash has been collected from customers – a company\r\nhas more sales with promises to pay, as opposed to actual cash payments.\r\nTherefore, an increase in accounts receivable results in a decrease in cash\r\nflow from operating activities. In short, an increase in a non-cash current asset account usually\r\ncauses a decrease in cash flow from operating activities. Conversely, a\r\ndecrease in a non-cash current asset account results in a net increase in cash\r\nflow from operating activities.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, an increase in accounts payable\r\nperiod over period has the opposite effect and results in an increase in cash\r\nflow. &nbsp;The amount of expense accrued and reflected on the\r\nincome statement was more than the amount of accounts payable that were paid to\r\nthe company’s suppliers. So, this increase in accounts payable must be added\r\nback to net income to show the company’s true cash position.&nbsp; In short, an increase in a current liability\r\naccount will result in an increase to cash flow from operating activities.\r\nConversely, a decrease in a current liability account results in a decrease to\r\ncash flow from operating activities. So, in comparison with changes in assets,\r\nwhich have an inverse relationship with cash flow, changes in liability\r\naccounts have a direct relationship. Once\r\nthese adjustments are added or subtracted from net income, they reveal a\r\ncompany’s actual change in cash from operating activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next section in the Statement of Cash\r\nFlows is cash flow from investing activities. This section incorporates cash\r\nflows from capital expenditures (also known as CAPEX) such as the balance sheet\r\naccount property, plant, and equipment. Also included in this section are cash\r\nflows from investing activities such as the purchase and sale, or maturity, of\r\ninvestment instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third main section of a company’s cash\r\nflow statement captures the cash flow from financing activities. Items captured\r\nin this section include cash inflows from the issuance of stock and bonds,\r\nspending cash to pay down debt, repurchase previously issued stock, and to pay\r\ndividends to shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning with net income, the changes in cash\r\nfrom operating, investing, and financing activities are added together to find\r\na company’s change in cash and equivalents. This change in cash is then added\r\nto cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the balance sheet period to\r\nyield the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, there are actually two\r\ndifferent methods that a company can use to calculate cash flow from operating\r\nactivities: the direct and indirect method. Most companies, use\r\nthe indirect method but another option is the direct method. Using the direct\r\nmethod, cash is reported from both cash receipts and cash disbursements from\r\noperating activities. The difference between receipts (cash received) and\r\ndisbursements (cash payments) will result in the net cash flow from operating\r\nactivities.&nbsp; Think of this as similar to\r\nreconciling a checkbook.</p>',1,0,0,1519435960,''),(23,3,5,0,'The Balance Sheet Explained','<p>Now, let’s take a more detailed look\r\nat the make-up of the balance sheet. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s an example of the assets\r\nsection of a balance sheet:</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n <tbody><tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p><b>Current assets:</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>Cash and cash\r\n  equivalents&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">$1,000,000</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>Trade and other\r\n  receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">750,000</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>Prepaid\r\n  expenses and other current assets</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">40,000</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p><b>Non-current\r\n  assets:</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>Property, plant\r\n  and equipment, net</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">$500,000</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>Goodwill and\r\n  other intangible assets</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80,000</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>Deferred tax\r\n  assets</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">30,000</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>Other\r\n  non-current assets</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><u>17,000</u></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n  <td width=\"465\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p><b>Total Assets</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n  <td width=\"108\" valign=\"top\">\r\n  <p align=\"right\"><b>$2,417,000</b></p>\r\n  </td>\r\n </tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total assets are composed of <b>current assets </b>and<b> non-current assets</b>.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current assets are assets that may be\r\nconverted into cash, sold or consumed within a year or less of the balance\r\nsheet date.

These calculations are essential to understanding the related\nconcepts, and are primary aspects of accounting. </p>\n\n<p>First, we’ll\nlook at calculations that relate to depreciation and amortization. Depreciation\nand amortization are key concepts in accounting - measuring the usefulness of\nan asset over time and gauging the remainder of its life. Depreciation is also a\nkey tax planning tool. </p>\n\n<p>Next, we\nwill focus on the methodology of inventory allocation. The term “inventory” often\nconjures isions of &nbsp;big warehouses filled\nwith row upon row of products and materials; however, a true understanding of\ninventory goes well beyond that.&nbsp; The\nmovement of inventory and the methodology a firm uses to account for that\ninventory &nbsp;can have a large impact on the\ncompany’s financial statements, including its overall profitability.</p><br></p>',1,0,0,1518217418,''),(27,4,2,0,'Depreciation','<p>In accounting, <b>depreciation</b> is an allocation method used to measure how a long-term\r\nasset, like a building or piece of equipment, ages and how the costs used to\r\nacquire that asset are utilized over time. &nbsp;In accordance with the matching principle,\r\ndepreciation is used to match the cost of an asset with the revenue it\r\ngenerates for a business over the asset’s useful life. Depreciation helps measure\r\na fixed asset’s net value over time - how much of its useful life has been consumed\r\nand how much remains. A fixed asset’s net value is based on the asset’s\r\nhistorical cost (the amount spent originally to obtain it) and the accumulated\r\ndepreciation recorded since the asset was placed in service. As a reminder from\r\nearlier chapters, historical cost does not adjust to the asset’s market value;\r\nit remains fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three main concepts tied to\r\ndepreciation which are critical to fully understanding the topic: <b>Estimated U</b><b><span lang=\"X-NONE\">seful </span></b><b>L</b><b><span lang=\"X-NONE\">ife</span></b><b>, S</b><b><span lang=\"X-NONE\">alvage </span></b><b>V</b><b><span lang=\"X-NONE\">alue</span></b><b>, and Net Book Value</b><span lang=\"X-NONE\">.\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Estimated useful life </b>is the period of time over which an asset will be\r\ndepreciated. The estimated useful life refers only to the time during which an\r\nasset is expected to be productive, and not necessarily how long the asset will\r\nphysically last<span lang=\"X-NONE\">. </span>For example, for depreciation purposes, accounting guidelines may\r\nestimate that the useful life of a forklift will be 20 years; however, in\r\nactuality, that forklift may be used in a factory for 30 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The\r\n<b>s</b><b><span lang=\"X-NONE\">alvage </span></b><b>v</b><b><span lang=\"X-NONE\">alue</span></b> is <span lang=\"X-NONE\">the\r\nestimated amount an asset would be sold for at the end of its useful life. </span>The salvage value estimate is made at the time the\r\nasset is acquired and may play a role in several different depreciation\r\nmethods. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Net book value (NBV)</b> is the estimated worth of the asset at any given time. Again, this is\r\nbased on the asset’s historical cost minus its accumulated depreciation. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depreciation allocates the cost of a\r\nlong-term asset to Depreciation Expense over time, rather than accounting for\r\nthe cost all at once – dividing the cost of the asset so that a portion is\r\nreported on each income statement issued over the estimated useful life of the\r\nlong-term asset.&nbsp; Since an asset will\r\npresumably support revenue generation over multiple accounting periods, the\r\nexpense should be “matched” with the revenue it helps generate.&nbsp; There are multiple depreciation methods\r\nallowed under US GAAP.&nbsp; Each method will calculate\r\nand, therefore, allocate, a different amount of depreciation expense each\r\naccounting period.&nbsp; Thus, the method used\r\ncan affect taxable income.&nbsp; In the\r\nfollowing pages, we will go over a few different ways to depreciate assets with\r\nthe same historical cost, useful life and salvage value, but each method will utilize\r\ndifferent calculations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the depreciation method,\r\nwe first need to account for the initial&nbsp;\r\ntransaction – the purchase of a long-term asset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Understanding the flow and cost\r\nof inventory is important to understanding and evaluating the financial state\r\nof many businesses.

This initial inventory purchase might be\r\nfinished product for resale or raw materials used to produce goods for sale,\r\ndepending on what type of business it is. Upon sale of that inventory to a\r\ncustomer, inventory on the balance sheet is decreased and the cost of goods\r\nsold is added to the income statement. As you may recall from earlier, this\r\naligns with the matching principle; the revenue generated from the sale of a\r\nproduct is matched with the expenses associated with obtaining or producing it.\r\nLike depreciation, businesses typically choose one of the three methods (FIFO,\r\nLIFO, and Weighted Average) to use consistently over time. Note that many\r\ncompanies follow a conservative lower of cost or market approach (LCM) with\r\nregards to an inventory’s historical cost.&nbsp;\r\nIf the value of inventory deteriorates over time such that the original\r\ncost is greater than the current market value, or net realizable value, the\r\ncarrying value of the inventory is written down on the balance sheet.&nbsp; Detailed analysis of LCM is beyond the scope\r\nof this course.&nbsp; Rather, we will explore\r\nhow each valuation method (FIFO, LIFO and Weighted Average) is calculated and\r\nthe impact each has on financial statements.

Whatever the relevant drivers, it’s important for business\r\nleaders to be able to identify those drivers and whether they are controllable\r\nor uncontrollable. &nbsp;This understanding of\r\ncontrol, or lack thereof, introduces a risk management perspective into a\r\nfirm’s variance analysis process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The OM walk\r\nchart below visually represents the $7 variance that has occurred in this\r\nexample.&nbsp; Note that this type of\r\ngraphical representation is often also referred to as an EBITDA walk as it is\r\nreconciling the change in pre-tax earnings without the impact of interest,\r\ndepreciation and amortization expenses.&nbsp;\r\nFor this analysis, these P&amp;L items are excluded – allowing\r\nmanagement &nbsp;to gauge the profitability generators\r\nthat are at least partially within their control and eliminate the effects of\r\nfinancing and certain accounting decisions such as depreciation methods.\r\n \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-750fe4e8-c5a7-8926-a780-85759a25879f\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8sOF4mLMYkoOVFw5WGyD3PmNJP7jkQb0Sid1VeRbaM_8XOq8e435a-3SbagQH6yQzmdvat2w574MPC8hwM6ipN3b4Z4TsoPXmolJv9OZCx6kJ1H-kMFKlKwaXayayeNxoHjckNSqkj8cVU2gnw\" width=\"481\" height=\"322\"></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the graphic, it appears that price\r\ndecreased period over period (price deflation, not inflation) and costs\r\nincreased overall – driving down operating margin (green bars indicate negative\r\nimpact on margin).&nbsp; In contrast, volume\r\nand productivity improved significantly – driving operating margin up (blue\r\nbars indicate positive impact on margin).&nbsp;\r\nThe next question then is which of these drivers is controllable and to\r\nwhat extent?&nbsp; If not controllable, how\r\ncan the firm mitigate any negative impact or, rather, drive positive change on\r\nits margins?&nbsp; For example, it is true\r\nthat OM improved period over period – that’s usually seen as positive\r\nperformance; however, the main driver of that improvement was\r\nproductivity.&nbsp; Are these types of process\r\nimprovements – lean activities, six sigma improvements, equipment efficiency\r\nand removal of waste, sustainable?&nbsp; What\r\nhappens next period if the company cannot generate further efficiency\r\ngains?&nbsp; What will offset price deflation\r\nand cost inflation if they reoccur? These are the types of questions an effective\r\nbusiness leader must ask and understand the answers to enact timely and ongoing\r\nimprovement in business performance.&nbsp; Otherwise,\r\ncommitments may not be met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An understanding of CVP can also help a\r\nbusiness leader in assessing various business scenarios.&nbsp;

In addition, as\r\nshown thus far, ratio analysis can help identify key drivers of financial\r\nperformance, highlighting potential ways for business leaders to impact and\r\nsustain positive change.&nbsp; However, ratio\r\nanalysis has its limitations. Ratios are typically comparable only across\r\nsimilar companies, since the parameters for an acceptable ratio in one industry\r\nmay be too high or too low in another. For example, ROS results for a grocery\r\nstore would be expected to be lower than that of a technology company, while\r\nasset turns would be much higher.&nbsp; This\r\nmakes sense since grocery store margins are traditionally lower but inventory\r\nis moved much more quickly.&nbsp; It’s ok to\r\nwait several weeks to install a new computer server in your business, but you\r\nwould not want your produce on a delivery truck for a month.&nbsp; Thus, ratio analysis can be effective when\r\ncomparing data over time and/or to plan for a specific company or across\r\nsimilar companies within an industry.</p><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1519440490,''),(46,5,8,0,'Free Cash Flow','<p></p><p>Another method commonly used for\r\nmeasuring a company’s financial performance is the calculation of <b>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</b>.&nbsp; As covered previously, the cash flow of a\r\nbusiness can be calculated using the following formula:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"@@PLUGINFILE@@/FCF.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"786\" height=\"153\" role=\"presentation\" class=\"img-responsive atto_image_button_text-bottom\"><br></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Free Cash Flow is a modified version of\r\nthe above calculated as:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Free Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation +\r\nAmortization – Change in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working\r\nCapital – Capital Expenditures</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that Cash Flow from Financing\r\nActivities is not included as part of FCF.&nbsp;\r\nFree Cash Flow represents cash available to meet the company’s financing\r\nneeds or, stated another way, cash that a company is able to generate after\r\nspending the money necessary to maintain or expand its asset base.

The medical diagnostic applications are significant.&nbsp; For example, healthy tissue patterns are compared to suspect tissue patterns to determine disease or abnormalities.&nbsp; This is done internally and electronically without the need for surgery. The moving force behind this innovative invention was Dr. Demitri R. Simkovy.&nbsp; Dr. Simkovy, born into a family with significant independent wealth, was a child prodigy fascinated by all aspects of bioengineering, the only engineering discipline that uses all of the natural sciences (biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics) to do what engineers do, which is design, optimize, and produce real processes and devices.&nbsp; After graduating (at the age of 17) from MIT with dual degrees in chemistry and computer science, Simkovy pursued a doctorate in bioengineering at Cal Tech. He achieved this distinction at the age of 20.</p><p></p><p> Although his life revolved around scientific learning, Dr. Simkovy also was a devotee of “Star Trek” – he was a “Trecky” of particular passion.&nbsp; The handheld body scanner Dr. McCoy often used when treating ill Starship Enterprise crewmembers especially mesmerized Simkovy. This extracurricular passion and his scientific training came together in nine years of independent, intense design and testing of what Dr. Simkovy always referred to as the “Real McCoy” – his version of a practicable, handheld, diagnostic, medical body scanner.&nbsp; In the tenth year of this effort, 2016, after applying for and receiving eleven different patents and developing what he believed to be was an efficient manufacturing process, Simkovy felt he had done all he could do and that the product was ready for commercialization.&nbsp; He was supremely confident of the product and its potential. Determined to assure that the scanner was primarily used to benefit mankind and would not become a profit magnet for a monopolist or for only two rivals, Dr. Simkovy took certain measures to assure that the competition that he felt was required to make the scanner widely available at a reasonable cost.&nbsp; First, he negotiated a three-year exclusive agreement with Four Ring Bioengineering (FRB, Ltd) of Shanghai, China to be the exclusive supplier of the hardware – a small handheld computer with integrated sensors, the physical body of the scanner – the “box”.&nbsp; He then negotiated a similar three-year agreement with The Atat Group’s Nanotechnology Division (Bangalore, India) to supply Diagnostic Processing Chips (DPCs), the scientific heart and soul of the scanner. </p><p>&nbsp;<br>Finally, he sought out companies that met four very particular criteria established to assure rapid market penetration of the Real McCoy: </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1.) Sufficient resources -- approaching a half billion dollars in profits</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.) Balance sheet strength -- low debt to equity ratio and operating cash flow relatively consistent with operating earnings </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3.) Technical superiority -- R&amp;D expenditures greater than 3% of revenues and a product vitality index greater than 25% </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 4.) Cultural strength -- entrepreneurial mindset focused on meeting commitments with integrity</p><p></p><p> After a long search, five companies were identified:&nbsp; <b>General Medical, Inc., NDT Corporation of America, Applied Science, Ltd., Medical Immunology Applications, and American Functional Kinetics</b>.&nbsp; By November 2016, Dr. Simkovy, with his attorneys, completed agreements with these companies licensing the technology, including use of the above-mentioned manufacturing process and supply agreements. Each company in turn established a new subsidiary with the charter to develop a successful, profitable Real McCoy business. General Medical, Inc. established Advanced Bioengineering Concepts.&nbsp; NDT Corporation established Molecular Electronics Applications. Applied Science, Ltd. established Real Time Diagnostics. Medical Immunology Applications established Superior Medical Diagnostics. American Functional Kinetics established Zenith Medical Manufacturing. All of these subsidiary companies have been in business since the beginning of 2017, that is, for eighteen months.&nbsp; Although very successful in the market, each has had significant manufacturing problems.&nbsp; Their factories consistently missed commitments.&nbsp; Costs were out of control. Productivity was negative.&nbsp; Customer promises were not kept.&nbsp; Quality was not meeting end market expectations. Consequently, each business made a decision to focus on its engineering design and marketing core competencies and to outsource their manufacturing. They each decided to sell their factory.</p><p> Concurrently, Manufacturing Excellence, Inc. (ManX) was looking for growth opportunities. ManX is a leading Manufacturing Services company that offers broad manufacturing services to aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, industrial, and medical OEM customers. ManX uses their world-class manufacturing and logistics expertise to enable customers to optimize supply chain operations, accelerate time to market and time to volume, and reduce capital investments and production costs. </p><p>Advanced Bioengineering Concepts, Molecular Electronics Applications and Real Time Diagnostics have already made contracts with ManX to manufacture the Real McCoy. Superior Medical Diagnostics and Zenith Medical Manufacturing are potential manufacturers, but no contract has been completed as of yet.&nbsp; There will be more news to come when you arrive at your new factory assignment.&nbsp; Each factory purchase agreement had a reciprocal contract whereby the factory seller agreed to become the ManX factory’s “prime customer”.&nbsp; ManX in turn agreed to meet each prime customer’s demand and quality requirements. Details of the contract with your customer are included in Part V of this document. </p><p>Because the profitable operations of these factories will require the focused management attention of outstanding performers, ManX opted to install a Program Management team in each factory.&nbsp;&nbsp; You, the participants in this class, are on one of the new Program Management teams (factories were named using the initials of their prime customer i.e. Advanced Bioengineering Concepts is ABC). Your challenge is to effectively manage this business: improve performance this year; make a commitment for next year’s profitability; achieve that commitment; and accomplish all of this with integrity.&nbsp; Good luck! <br></p>',1,0,1521736494,1521757014,''),(50,6,4,0,'Current Sitaution','<p></p><p>THE REAL MCCOY </p><p>The Real McCoy is a handheld, medical diagnostic scanner, patterned roughly after the scanner used by Dr. McCoy in the long running science fiction television series, “Star Trek”.&nbsp; Developed by Dr. Demitri Simkovy, the Real McCoy’s technical objective is to accurately assess a patient’s health without requiring any invasive procedures.&nbsp; The goal is to make a scientific assessment of what is happening at the cellular level, compare that insight to both a large, integral database, as well as to information acquired through more traditional medical diagnostic techniques, and provide diagnostic output that improves the health practitioners’ everyday decisions. <img width=\"185\" height=\"274\" class=\"img-responsive atto_image_button_right\" role=\"presentation\" alt=\"\" src=\"@@PLUGINFILE@@/q.PNG\"><br>&nbsp;<br>The body of the scanner (the “box”) is constructed out of duranium, a metal alloy that provides superior durability and required internal stability.&nbsp; Its optic lenses and mirrors are manufactured using dicosilium and capitalize on nanotechnology molecular electronics for data capture.&nbsp; The Diagnostic Processing Chip or DPC, a microprocessor that assimilates all of the captured data, integrates that data, and correlates it with internal and external databases, is a nanotechnology-based super computer with parallel 750-gigabyte NRAM memory chips.

The decision input process will be reviewed at the start of the exercise. </p><p></p><p><b>Material</b></p><p> How many units of raw material will you order each period? There are two key material components that you must order.&nbsp; First is the Diagnostic Processing Chip (DPC) that is sourced from India. Each Real McCoy produced requires 2 DPCs; each McCoy2 requires 3 DPCs.&nbsp; The second component is a handheld computer-like devise (the “Box”) that comes from China. Both Real McCoy and McCoy2 require one “Box” each. Both components have an order delivery cycle of 90 days with deliveries at the beginning the quarter after the quarter in which the order was placed. Each supplier sets payment terms. The manufacturing process has had issues that have caused scrap. The scrap rate must be considered in your planning.&nbsp; The number of DPCs and “Boxes” ordered, delivered and available for production impacts production capacity and costs. All other production materials needed are supplied as needed, no advanced ordering is required, and no shortages will occur.&nbsp;</p><p><b> Production </b></p><p>How many units of finished goods will you produce each period? The answer to this question depends on questions related to your prime customer’s requirements forecast, product mix, production capacity, inventory management, workforce morale and costs, as examples. Capacity can limit production, but management must decide whether to produce at or below capacity. </p><p><b>Labor </b></p><p>How many production employees do you wish to employ each period? Production employees fall into three categories: those 11 who are necessary to operate the plant regardless of the level of production; those that operate the manufacturing insertion/loading machines (ILMs); and those who perform quality assurance functions. All production employees receive the same base pay and are under the control of factory supervisors.&nbsp; Specifically excluded from this category of employees are management personnel and overhead people accounted for and paid under other accounts. The number of production employees has an impact on production, capacity and costs. The most experienced employees are assigned to base plant operations, then to the insertion/loading machines and then as Quality Assurance Associates (QAAs). The decision here is the number to be hired or laid off during the period. </p><p><b>Overtime</b></p><p> Your customer had agreed with the hourly workforce that only Saturdays would be used for overtime – no second shifts, no third shifts, no Sundays.&nbsp; (The only exception to this agreement is that second shift ILM operation is allowed with a 15% shift differential.) Furthermore, the agreement is that if Saturday work is required there will be no partial shifts.&nbsp; The entire factory will work and be paid time-and-a-half for the Saturday work.&nbsp; In his negotiations, Mr. Nelson agreed to honor these commitments for 24 months.&nbsp; This agreement is part of your contract with the customer.&nbsp; Your decisions are how many, if any, Saturdays to work and how many ILMs you wish to operate on second shift.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Price </b></p><p>How much money will you charge for your prime customer for products produced each period?&nbsp; This decision is governed by your contract with that customer.&nbsp; Because this is a very new business, Mr. Nelson agreed with the customer that using the average of actual financial data from Q2 2018 and Pro Forma projections for 2018-3 &amp; 4 was the fairest basis on which to establish price.&nbsp; Furthermore, because of the extremely fast growth anticipated by these exciting products with the resultant projected experience curve cost benefits, the prime customer successfully negotiated quarterly 2019&nbsp; price decreases. Past experience suggests that customers are particularly intractable when any price increases from contracted levels are suggested. </p><p><b>Terms</b></p><p> What payment terms will you expect from your prime customer?&nbsp; Although this decision can have an immediate impact on cash flow, it is also governed by your contract with your customer.&nbsp; Furthermore, keep in mind that establishing specific payment terms does not necessarily mean the customer will pay in exactly that number of days.</p><p><b> Insertion Loading Machines (ILM)</b></p><p> How many ILMs will be ordered for the next period? How many ILMs should be operated on second shift?&nbsp; These machines are at the heart of the manufacturing process – you must have ILM capacity in order to produce.&nbsp; Although the number of ILMs and whether or not to operate ILMs on second shift are Manufacturing decisions, they must be closely coordinated with Production Planning and Supply Chain Management to assure manufacturing capacity is synchronized with the business’s growth plans. </p><p><b>Universal Electronic Test Machines (UETM)</b></p><p> How many UETMs will be ordered for the next period? These machines have the potential to increase quality assurance throughput, to reduce operating costs by reducing the number of QAAs required, and to increase overall process output faster than adding employees. There are risks associated with this decision. The technology and the UETM are new, unproven and not readily available. Lease costs are unpredictable, savings uncertain, and people are emotional. In deciding the machine question, be aware that one can increase quality assurance throughput by adding more QAAs, UETMs or a combination of the two. </p><p><b>Quality Engineering</b></p><p> How much money will you invest in quality engineering each period? Quality engineering dollars are used to improve and maintain the quality of the product. These expenditures involve testing, inspection, product improvement, design, analysis, and development of equipment and professional personnel (engineers). You cannot allocate these funds, but you can see the results through quality reports, customer input, and other means of feedback relating to quality. Although the lease of the Universal Electronic Test Machines is often a quality engineering decision, the costs of those leases are accounted for separately and are not supported by Quality Engineering dollars. Quality Engineering dollars determine the quality of the product produced. This may put the Quality Engineering manager in conflict with other functional managers competing for dollars.</p><p><b> Six Sigma Assignment</b></p><p> Your two Master Black Belts have been working on improving the efficiency of the quality assurance process.&nbsp; As there is additional opportunity, you probably want to continue this focus in the short term.&nbsp; Longer term, as new opportunities surface, you will have to decide how to deploy this valuable resource.&nbsp; Here you must decide which assignment you wish the MBBs to pursue.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>General and Administrative Costs</b></p><p> How much money will be expended each period for administrative expenditures? In addition to other administrative overhead, G&amp;A includes a quarterly Corporate Assessment of $80,000; you will pay this minimum amount regardless of your decision.&nbsp; You should also keep in mind that a major cut could severely impact the management team’s morale and effectiveness – which may be reflected in hourly workforce performance and as well as the organization’s ability to effectively execute initiatives.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The interaction of your decisions and the impact those decisions have on your factory capabilities, on your business’s economics, and on your customer’s competitiveness will determine the end result of the decisions you make.&nbsp; Be perceptive in your analysis, resolute in your decision-making. <br></p>',1,0,1521739038,1521759565,''),(54,6,8,0,'Part IV: Pro Forma Financials','<p>(images)<br></p>',1,0,1521747912,1521747912,''),(56,6,9,0,'Part V: Prime Customer Contract Extract (Essential Provisions)','<p>Contract Term:&nbsp; July 1, 2018 – June 30, 2021 (3 years)  Price:&nbsp; Selling prices to the prime customer will be as indicated:&nbsp; 2018-3 2018-4 2019 -1 2019 -2 2019 -3 2019 -4 2020-1 Real McCoy $10,000 $10,000 $9,800 $9,600 $9,400 $9,200 $9,000 McCoy2 $10,750 $10,750 $10,600 $10,400 $10,200 $10,000 $10,000 </p><p><br>&nbsp; Payment Terms:&nbsp; 30 days (both products)  Quarterly Forecast:&nbsp; Customer will provide a rolling four-quarter outlook, by product line, at the beginning of each quarter.&nbsp; The customer reserves the right to update that forecast during the quarter.&nbsp; The customer agrees to freeze final quantities for the current quarter one month (30 days) before quarter’s end.  Fulfillment:&nbsp; The Factory agrees to ship to the prime customer’s demand requirements.&nbsp; The customer agrees to take all product included in the current quarter’s “frozen” forecast.&nbsp; The factory agrees to pay the customer $100.00 per unit for any short shipments.&nbsp; This penalty is negotiable at the factory’s request and the customer’s discretion.&nbsp; At the customer’s sole discretion, at the end of 2019, 2020, and 2021, a bonus may be paid for meeting delivery commitments for the year.&nbsp; The Factory is precluded from selling to any other customer for the first six months of this contract; in 2019&nbsp; the Factory is permitted to sell up to 20% of its volume to other than the prime customer in non-US markets.  Quality:&nbsp; The factory agrees to meet or exceed the customer’s quality expectation of a minimum of 4.8 sigma measured by the customer using its incoming inspection process.&nbsp; The customer agrees to provide the factory with a quarterly scorecard that measures that quality.&nbsp; The factory agrees to pay the customer $50,000 (Other Costs) in any quarter where quality falls below 4.25.&nbsp; This penalty is negotiable at the factory’s request and the customer’s discretion.  Overtime:&nbsp; The factory agrees to honor the customer’s commitment to the hourly workforce.

Lewis </p><p><br>&nbsp;SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION OF PERSONNEL <br>&nbsp;There has been some confusion among the staff about the different categories of personnel in the factory and how they are paid. This memo identifies the categories and the source of funding for each. Copies will be sent to all managers for use in their operations. Management Personnel: These are the Program Management Team and some support function staff managers. This category also includes your Master Black Belts whose activities benefit the business as a whole. Compensation for these personnel is funded as an expense to the factory (within General and Administrative Expenses) and is mostly under the control of management. Engineering Personnel: These are the product, quality, and production engineers who work to improve the quality of the product and our processes. Compensation for these personnel is funded from the dollars allocated to the quality engineering function by management each quarter. Security, Maintenance, Custodial Personnel: These contract personnel keep the building operational. Compensation for these personnel is funded from the fixed production expense paid by the factory each quarter and is included in Manufacturing Overhead. Production Personnel: These are the production personnel required to operate the factory, the production lines and to perform the quality assurance functions. A minimum of 11 people (machine shop, equipment maintenance, receiving, material handling, box/pack and ship) is essential for the factory to operate. Because their presence is necessary regardless of the level of production, they do not figure in the throughput or capacity calculations of the plant. Of the other hourly people, the most experienced are assigned as machine adjusters/loaders for the ILM machines. When new employees are hired, they will be Quality Assurance Associates (QAAs). Supervisors move workers throughout the plant to optimize production and quality. All production personnel, regardless of function or job, receive the same pay with rates set as agreed to by prior management (now your prime customer). Their salary and benefits are charged as a quarterly expense to the factory and are included in Conversion Costs. <br>&nbsp; Note that prior management had agreed to increase hourly wages by 5% at the start of 2019. Although this is a moral, not a contractual, obligation, in my opinion any reduction would negatively impact morale and productivity. <br></p>',1,0,1521754158,1521754158,''),(60,6,12,0,'Program General Manager 2','<p>PGM Human Resources Manufacturing Engineering Sourcing Finance&nbsp; ♦ ♦&nbsp;&nbsp; ♦ <br>&nbsp;<br>MEMORANDUM FOR:&nbsp; PROGRAM GENERAL MANAGER </p><p><br>&nbsp;MEMORANDUM FROM: MANAGER, EMPLOYEE RELATIONS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John L.

This number includes a baseline work force of 11 established last year as the minimum number of workers we need to operate the general functions of the factory.&nbsp; Of the remaining employees, 6 are assigned to the ILM machines and the others are operating as Quality Assurance Associates. Of these, 8 were hired during the second quarter of this year to increase throughput and to replace two who quit. At 100% effectiveness quarterly throughput has averaged about 42 units per QAA. New hires operate at approximately 80% effectiveness for the quarter in which they are hired; because of some seemingly intractable process issues, experienced QAAs are about 95% effective. The current work force provides a potential production capacity of about 945 units per quarter at 100% yield. All production workers receive the same pay; all work 40 hour weeks, and 65-day quarters. The Insertion Loading Machines (ILMs) that produce the Real McCoy have a current production capacity of 135 units per machine.&nbsp; Each ILM requires one machine adjuster/operator.&nbsp; Currently 6 ILMs are installed and operating.&nbsp; Because of process yield and quality concerns the ILMs have only been operating on first shift. We do have attrition in our work force. Employees leave for various reasons no matter what we do.&nbsp; Quits are highest whenever we upset the status quo too greatly by hiring or laying off large numbers of workers.&nbsp; Turbulence is expensive in several ways. Each hire costs us $2000 and each layoff costs us $4000. We do not have a charge for those who quit, but they must be replaced by new hires if we are to keep up production. All promotions are from within; thus, vacancies are filled from the QAA pool. Labor rates were decided last year by management after extensive discussions with the Employee Committee.&nbsp; Those decisions covered labor costs through December 31, 2019. Wages, benefits and working conditions have not been a problem so far; job security is a vital concern. Management also agreed to communicate with employees before further automating the production or quality assurance processes. Those decisions also included very specific agreements about overtime. Disputes between management and the hourly workforce have typically been settled by discussions with the Employee Committee. This has been workable so far.&nbsp; The leader of the Employee Committee is Mr. Brian (Swig) McDonald. <br></p>',1,0,1521754256,1521754256,''),(61,6,13,0,'Manager, Personnel','<p>PGM Human Resources Manufacturing Engineering Sourcing Finance&nbsp; ♦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>MEMORANDUM FOR:&nbsp; MANAGER, PERSONNEL </p><p><br>&nbsp;MEMORANDUM FROM: Brian McDonald, Employee Committee </p><p><br>&nbsp;SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp; MACHINES VS.

My concern about this information relates back to our previous conversations about the impact of personnel reductions.&nbsp; The discussions we have been through in the past year have focused on job security, a key concern of your workforce. Even though you have committed to increase our wages next year, and benefits are generally considered adequate, this will not guarantee harmony in our work force if we begin replacing workers with machines. We are already in a machine intensive industry with most of the workers allocated to quality assurance rather than production functions. Security and janitorial tasks have been outsourced. The ILMs require only one employee (this should be two)! Now, if the QAAs are replaced, the only work left will be machine shop, equipment maintenance, inventory, administration and shipping. We cannot allow this to happen! You should expect that automation will cause considerable reaction among the workers, and I cannot predict the consequences. If there is no basis for my concern, please reassure me as soon as possible.

Real McCoy production is both machine and people intensive. Fortunately, the manufacture of the product is done virtually 100 percent by machine. The ILM lines require only one machine adjustor/operator per machine. The labor-intensive portion of the process is the quality assurance tasks that take place before and after the ILM process. We have a highly technical medical product that must pass a series of electronic and human tests (many FDA mandated) before we can allow the product to go out to be used on patients. Because the quality assurance steps are critical, exacting, and time consuming, the workstations frequently are backed up and can be bottlenecks in the production process. The only means we presently have to resolve the problem is to hire more QAAs. The Real McCoy consists of a handheld programmable electronic device, with integrated sensors (the “box”), two diagnostic processing chips (DPC), and our proprietary databases and operating system. The “boxes” are imported from China and the DPCs from India.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both are stored in Raw Material inventory until initiated into the production process. All other materials are delivered from local vendors on a just-in-time (JIT) basis and are not inventoried. The quality of the Real McCoy depends on a functioning “box” and DPCs properly assembled and loaded with software and data. Hourly employees inspect the raw material input and test /calibrate each completed unit at a series of stations that precede and follow the manufacturing process. (Failures are reworked by the QAAs – see following memo.) Then the Real McCoy is packed and transferred to finished goods inventory. (A notional process map is attached) We have been labor constrained on Real McCoy production because of the QAA requirements. We must have sufficient QAAs to increase throughput. I realize there is a cost of hiring and training workers, but the cost of losing workers who quit because they are overworked is ultimately higher. Quality Engineering and our Master Black Belts continue to find ways to improve the production process without sacrificing quality. There is good news and bad news about the scrap rate.&nbsp; The good news is that the issue is isolated to DPC loading, the first stage in our manufacturing process.&nbsp; As a result, we only lose the DPCs, no other material, and no labor.&nbsp; The bad news is that so far the issue seems intractable.&nbsp; Quality Engineering has not been able to dedicate resources to solving this issue.&nbsp; Further, I know some have suggested our delivery performance is inconsistent.&nbsp; Quite frankly, I don’t understand this.&nbsp; Our manufacturing metrics indicate we have done a great job.

We have done some analysis to understand the root causes of low yields.&nbsp; Several factors are contributors:  Workforce disruption -- major change in size of workforce  Significant change in number of machines in the factory  Under funding Quality Engineering We also speculate that running the ILMs on second shift or working the factory on Saturdays could pull yields down. Stability in the factory, humane schedules, and investment in Quality seem to be the key to increasing yields. <br></p>',1,0,1521754736,1521754736,''),(66,6,18,0,'Program General manager 4','<p>PGM Human Resources Manufacturing Engineering Sourcing Finance&nbsp;&nbsp; ♦&nbsp;&nbsp; ♦ <br>&nbsp;<br>MEMORANDUM FOR: PROGRAM GENERAL MANAGER </p><p><br>&nbsp;MEMORANDUM FROM: SHOP SUPERINTENDENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav Gashford </p><p><br>&nbsp;SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp; PRODUCTION LABOR <br>&nbsp;Production of the Real McCoy is both machine and labor intensive. Machines produce the product with minimum workers to load, tend, and unload the machines, but we require extraordinary labor to perform the critical QA functions. We must maintain 11 workers at all times for basic factory operations regardless of the number of Real McCoys we produce. We also need one operator for each ILM machine. The current total of 42 production workers includes the base factory requirement, the ILM operators, and the QAAs. The supervisors distribute the work force throughout the plant as needed to optimize throughput. Labor costs are increasing. Management provided/committed to a four percent raise in 1st quarter 2018 and five percent raise in 1st quarter of 2019. Agreed to wage rates are: WAGE RATE (Per worker)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2017&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2018 2019 Per day $238.46 $246.15 $258.47 Per quarter 65 days/qtr) $15,500 $16,000 $16,800<br>&nbsp;<br>Production capacity can be increased by adding ILM machines or by working some of the machines on second shift.&nbsp; Operating a second shift does require maintenance support and security from our contract service.&nbsp; Running up to 8 machines on second shift would cost an incremental $35,000 in Manufacturing Overhead.&nbsp; Also, we have agreed to pay any second shift ILM operators a 15% shift differential.&nbsp; Because of maintenance requirements, we are not able to run a second shift on Saturdays. Expansion of our inspection throughput can be accomplished by increasing the number of workers to perform the QA functions. We can work Saturday overtime, but only if all workers are working. Hourly workers are paid at time and a half for Saturday work. We do what we can with what we have. We have many options to solve this problem. We could increase the individual’s throughput from the present 42 units per quarter, increase the number of workers (although it is getting harder and harder to find skilled employees), work Saturdays, and/or find a machine that will do the quality assurance functions faster, cheaper and as well as the present workers do.&nbsp; I realize we have two Black Belts working on this issue and hope they will be successful.&nbsp; We have to find other creative solutions to the problem.&nbsp; These solutions will require additional resources, most likely in the form of funding and time.<br></p>',1,0,1521754817,1521754817,''),(67,6,19,0,'Program General Manager 5','<p>PGM Human Resources Manufacturing Engineering Sourcing Finance&nbsp;&nbsp; ♦&nbsp; ♦ ♦&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>MEMORANDUM FOR: PROGRAM GENERAL MANAGER </p><p><br>&nbsp;MEMORANDUM FROM: SHOP SUPERINTENDENT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustav Gashford </p><p><br>&nbsp;SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp; RAW MATERIALS FOR PRODUCTION <br>&nbsp;Material The Real McCoy production process uses three categories of materials: electronic connectors and resins, the diagnostic processing chip (DPC), and the electronic processing device (the “box”). Availability and timely delivery of the electronic connectors and resins are not a problem. Suppliers deliver the quantities we need when we need them; thus, we neither stock nor inventory these materials. The costs are proportionally small and are grouped together as other material costs. The DPCs and “boxes” are a different matter. The sole source suppliers for the industry are: Atat Nanotechnology, Bangalore, India for the DPC; Four Ring Bioengineering (FRB, Ltd.), Shanghai, China for the “box”. It is our understanding that the exclusive licenses with both of these suppliers are due to expire in January 2020. Until then we cannot expect alternative sources.&nbsp; We need to be concerned about our raw material suppliers because they are located considerable distances away and are global suppliers with customers in different industries. DPC prices have recently been increased 6.7% after staying flat all of last year.&nbsp; Atat’s standard terms are net 30. “Box” prices are expected to increase about 3% in 2018-3 and expected to increase again at the beginning of 2019.&nbsp; FRB indicated these projected increases reflect nothing more than a pass through of their expected increase in costs of labor, taxes and purchased components. FRB does not expect to change their standard terms of net 15 days. In both cases we had been expecting price declines because of the expanding industry volumes and the anticipation of strong competition when their licenses expire. Scrap We currently do have an issue with DPCs scrapped during the manufacturing process. The scrap rate has hovered around 2.5%.&nbsp; With limited resources, Quality Engineering has done an admirable job keeping the scrap rate from soaring out of control. We have confirmed that this issue is ours, not Atat’s.&nbsp; I believe we should focus our Master Black Belts on finding a permanent fix.&nbsp; Fortunately, our intensive quality process contains this problem in-house – this issue is transparent to our customers – but it is still expensive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br>Inventory We must coordinate material strategies with production and customer forecasts. The uncertainty, real or imagined, concerning DPC and “box” availability, plus the quarter we must wait for delivery, require sufficient inventory to support production plans (including the above mentioned scrap). Both vendors have contractually committed that backorders will not exceed 10% of the quantities ordered for delivery in the current quarter.&nbsp; To date there have been no backorders, but industry demand is increasing dramatically.&nbsp; The contract does require that any backordered items be shipped in the next quarter and billed at the price in effect that quarter. We pay an inventory carrying charge each quarter currently calculated at 6% of the combined raw material and finished goods inventory at the end of the quarter. This means we need to monitor inventories. The bottom line is that we must have two DPCs (after any scrap loss) and one “box” to produce one Real McCoy (three DPCs for a M2)&nbsp; -- no components, no product. Costs We order DPCs and ‘boxes” each quarter for delivery at the beginning of the next quarter. We have had all orders filled to date and defective materials have been automatically replaced per the exclusive license agreements.&nbsp; Atat’s&nbsp;&nbsp; price of $800 per unit is not expected to change again this year. On the other hand, FRB’s current cost of $4160 per “box” is expected to increase to $4280 in Q3 of this year Other material costs are expected to continue to average about $10 per unit as in the past. Vendor Relations Consistent with our Strategic Supplier Management (SSM) initiative we have attempted to maintain excellent relationships with all of our suppliers.&nbsp; Atat Nanotechnology has been an excellent supplier that communicates with us consistently and clearly.&nbsp; Ms. Sipperly, Atat’s US representative, seems committed to a long-term partnership. Unfortunately, our relationship with FRB, Ltd. has not been as smooth.&nbsp; Mr. Varden, FRB’s VP of North American Sales, has been less forthcoming. You would characterize him as neither open nor forthright.&nbsp; He has indicated that FRB’s costs have been escalating and we should expect price increases again next year.&nbsp; FRB, unlike Atat, has been unwilling to make firm written commitments on price or terms. Mr. Varden seems unconcerned that FRB’s exclusive supply contract will soon have to be renegotiated.&nbsp; “The quality of our product and its value to our customers speaks for Four Ring Bioengineering” is what he declared in our last conversation.&nbsp; Despite this apparent arrogance, FRB’s quality and delivery have been outstanding.&nbsp; They ship quarterly from Shanghai to their Louisville, Kentucky cross-dock point and then deliver to us at the beginning of the quarter to meet our projected production needs. In both cases we do understand that expediting is possible but experience suggests that this could be quite expensive. Our philosophy is that good planning is a cardinal cornerstone of achieving operational/growth goals at competitive costs.&nbsp; Expediting is a clear indicator of poor planning and we try to assure that this does not occur in our shop. <br></p>',1,0,1521754922,1521754922,''),(68,6,20,0,'Atat Nanotechnology','<p>PGM Human Resources Manufacturing Engineering Sourcing Finance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ♦ ♦ <br><br>Atat Nanotechnology Bangalore, India <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SUBJECT: PRICE AND POLICY ANNOUNCEMENT&nbsp; </p><p><br>&nbsp;TO:&nbsp; OUR CUSTOMERS </p><p><br>&nbsp;Since we began producing the Diagnostic Processing Chip (DPC) under special license arrangements with the eminent Dr. Simkovy, we have given our customers timely updates of our price and delivery policies.&nbsp; In this update we are adding a comment about quality.

We will not back order any customer without first trying to notify that customer that a problem has occurred. Quality: We stand behind our products. We will replace defective DPCs returned to us.

Here is some background and an introduction to the evaluation I’ll give you later when the staff budget requests are presented. To date, we have produced a quality product in spite of some very difficult situations. We have a problem with the supplier of the DPC. Atat Nanotechnoloy occasionally has sent defective DPCs that our folks discovered. Had we not found them, the customers would have. I continue to work hard to get Atat to tighten up their operation, but since they are the only DPC supplier, they pretty much do as they wish. The upside is they have replaced all defective DPCs at no cost to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our staff has worked hard to solve the DPC scrap issue.&nbsp; Root cause analysis has clearly shown the problem is ours, not Atat’s.&nbsp; And we know the locus of the problem is DPC loading into the ILMs.&nbsp; Given sufficient time and investment, we are confident we can solve this problem. The good news is that the computers (“boxes”) we get from FRB have had excellent quality (zero defects to date) and there has been no “box” scrap. Our strength and our weakness are in the men and women who do our quality assurance. They alone insure the quality control of our production. They are doing a fine job, but they are the weak link in the throughput chain. Our production machines (ILMs) are very reliable (except for this seemingly intractable scrap issue), and the physical plant is adequate for our immediate needs. We can and have increased QAAs to increase throughput, but this remains an expensive option that is getting more expensive each year. Until recently, we had no option. We have learned of a universal test machine being made in New Jersey that we are investigating. Finally, we need to continue to invest in our Quality Engineering organization. Reports suggest our quality scores have slipped a bit as we have continued to ramp up production.&nbsp; This is understandable. I realize quality is not a variable cost, but the organization does have to grow with the business.&nbsp; Please do not starve Peter to pay Paul.<br></p>',1,0,1521755022,1521755022,''),(70,6,22,0,'Quality Inspection Machine','<p>PGM Human Resources Manufacturing Engineering Sourcing Finance&nbsp;&nbsp; ♦ ♦&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>MEMORANDUM FOR: MANAGER, MANUFACTURING </p><p><br>&nbsp;MEMORANDUM FROM: MANAGER, ENGINEERING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp; SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp; QUALITY INSPECTION MACHINE <br>&nbsp;At a recent trade show, I met Jack Kelly of DeForrest &amp; Kelly Test Equipment, Inc (D&amp;K, INC). When Kelly learned about the Real McCoy, he was anxious to tell me of a new machine his company is producing called the Universal Electronic Test Machine (UETM). I followed up the trade show encounter by visiting his plant in New Jersey last week. I believe the UETM is something we can use. The UETM uses advanced electro-optical, robotics and laser technology to inspect and test microcircuits, chips, sensors and systems.&nbsp; The beauty of the UETM is that it is programmable to perform specific tasks needed on a production line. The biggest advantage, of course, is that the machine can increase our throughput at less cost than hiring additional QAAs. D&amp;K’s engineers claim each UETM could have an initial throughput of about 125 units per quarter in our operations. Compared to our current average throughput of about 42 units per QAA per quarter, that could mean one machine doing the work of 3 QAAs. The machine will not eliminate QAAs, however. For each machine, two workers are required. The trade-offs are in our favor. The UETM lease prices quoted to me are not firm since they have yet to go into full production. Kelly told me he’d give us an introductory discounted rate of approximately $10,000 per quarter if we order before July 2018. After that we will be billed at the standard quarterly lease rate.&nbsp;&nbsp; To increase capacity by:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add: At a Cost of: 125 units 3 workers $75,000/Qtr&nbsp; OR 125 units 1 UETM $10,000/Qtr&nbsp; Plus&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 workers $50,000/Qtr <br>&nbsp;The above is based on today’s productivity and labor rates (including overhead) but it demonstrates how we could reduce costs by replacing workers with UETMs. The big unknown is how well the UETM can do the job? If we let a lot of defective products get to our customer our internal goals could be stymied.

This may be just the thing we need to increase our throughput and reduce our costs. I’m concerned about our ability to produce quality Real McCoys in the quantity that meets our anticipated volume. Even factoring out some optimism, the future looks very good for the Real McCoy. We need to think production, and make specific plans to expand capacity. Of course, that means we must increase the throughput at all quality stations. That brings us back to the UETM. There are a lot of unknowns about the UETM: a. Actual throughput vs. estimated - How close will they be? b. Effectiveness - Will it do the job? c. Costs - Will lease rates skyrocket? d. Delivery - Can we get them on time? e. Reliability - Will they be there when we need them? f. Disruption - How much disruption during installation? g.

The Black Belts are working on this now.&nbsp; There are a couple of new and different approaches our work to date has suggested.&nbsp; I am currently compiling the costs and expected benefits of each. <br>&nbsp; DPC Scrap Rate: Quality Engineering has done a valiant job keeping the scrap rate under control but manufacturing would like to eliminate this problem.&nbsp; Over and above the obvious cost of material losses, because of our sole source situation, Manufacturing would like to see every DPC we get end up in a finished product. I agree this should be the objective. <br>&nbsp; Service Response Time:&nbsp; Apparently customers are complaining about late and inconsistent deliveries but Manufacturing metrics don’t point to any problem.&nbsp; Understanding “Rule Number One – The Customer Is Always Right” suggests we should try to get to the bottom of this situation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; While I realize training commitments limit available time, I will complete an analysis of each of these issues by the fourth quarter.&nbsp; Then you will have to make a decision. <br></p>',1,0,1521755805,1521755805,''),(73,6,25,0,'Improving QA Throughput','<p>PGM Human Resources Manufacturing Engineering Sourcing Finance&nbsp; ♦ ♦ ♦&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>MEMORANDUM FOR: MANAGER, MANUFACTURING </p><p><br>&nbsp;MEMORANDUM FROM: MANAGER, ENGINEERING </p><p><br>&nbsp;SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp; IMPROVING QA THROUGHPUT <br>&nbsp;You have been aware of the efforts of our Master Black Belts to reengineer some of our QA processes with a goal of greater efficiency and increased throughput.

We still have to analyze some process design changes and possible workstation modifications, but if all goes well, we could see some improvements shortly. That’s the good news; now the bad.

The technology uses sonics, phonics, and bionics wrapped together by computers, lasers and mechanics.&nbsp; It is all beyond my understanding, but the end result has been a prosperous company.&nbsp; By the way, DeForrest seems to have been an initial silent partner in this company but is no longer active. <br>&nbsp; Estimates indicate D&amp;K had sales of $8 million last year and profits of $1 million.&nbsp; Although revenues are increasing, the jury is still out on quality and reliability.

Generally, customers are satisfied.&nbsp; D&amp;K has also had internal production problems. Design and completion dates have slipped and a number of potential customers have decided not to buy after placing orders that were late in being filled.&nbsp; The good news is that D&amp;K has made major improvements in this area in the last six months; the bad news is that D&amp;K is the only current manufacturer of this inspection technology, and they are able to demand a 3-year lease for the equipment. Once you sign on with D&amp;K, you pay the lease costs whether the equipment is used or not.&nbsp; There are also some limitations on machine usage.&nbsp; This situation will likely continue for at least two more years. <br>&nbsp; That’s all I’ve been able to find out to date.

Equipment Lease Expense The current $350,000 quarterly expense is the cost of our lease on the factory building and includes general service equipment (electrical, pneumatic, heat, fluid and waste systems).&nbsp; We entered into this lease concurrent with our initiating the Real McCoy business.&nbsp; The lease is for three years and the cost is fixed.&nbsp; There is no cost escalation.&nbsp; We are responsible for any leasehold improvements.&nbsp; Changes to the structure of the building (load bearing walls, roof, and the like) cannot be made without the approval of the lessor, TRI Corporation, of Alexandria, Virginia.&nbsp; The lease can be renegotiated after two years and includes a provision that would allow us to sublease if required.&nbsp; The Equipment Lease Expense account will be impacted if we choose to pursue the UETM machines. Equipment Lease Expense does not include the cost of the Insertion Loading Machines (ILMs) that we purchase, capitalize and depreciate over six years.&nbsp; Those are purchased from Grundy Manufacturing Equipment, Inc. Current catalog price is currently $600,000. Warranty As this is a brand new product and we have essentially no experience with technical problems in our installed base, we have opted to book warranty expense directly to variable costs as incurred.&nbsp; Our accountants have advised us that once we have three years of experience under our belt, enough time to do a meaningful warranty tail analysis, we should shift to a warranty reserve process.&nbsp; Our products do carry a standard three-year warranty.&nbsp; Warranty repairs are outsourced to avoid production disruptions. Our repair vendor is Diagnostic Equipment Services, LLC (DES), a small local job shop with an excellent reputation for quality and service.&nbsp; The owner, Mrs. Virginia Clayton, continues to be interested in an ongoing partnership. Returns are sent directly to DES, necessary repairs made, the product is returned to the customer, and costs (including mark-up) are billed under a debit card process. We do monitor both volume and quality on a sampling basis.&nbsp; In the last quarter, warranty cost was approximately 4% of sales.&nbsp; If we can keep our product quality up, I am sure this cost will remain low. <br></p>',1,0,1521756009,1521756009,''),(76,6,28,0,'Variable Overhead','<p>PGM Human Resources Manufacturing Engineering Sourcing Finance ♦&nbsp; ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ <br>&nbsp;<br>Variable Overhead Variable overhead includes benefits on direct labor, maintenance supplies, shop utilities, shipping materials and miscellaneous factory supplies.&nbsp; These costs tend to vary with direct labor dollars, have been running about 50% of direct labor, and are expected to continue at approximately that level.
