What I like most about the McCoy Lite is the ability to tap into a new industrial market with the 5-10% discounted price while maintaining a 27% AARG.  I think pursuing the Lite will result in lower costs up front and requires fewer DPCs which will allow for easier inventory management to mitigate any supply concerns.  Even with higher marketing costs and potential cannibalization of the Real McCoy, the model indicates a favorable NPV and IRR compared to the McCoy 2.  I also think a pricing strategy of providing the McCoy Lite at a 10% discount at the beginning to gain additional market share will give an edge for future sales and demand.  We can slowly increase price on both the McCoy lite and Real McCoy over time once it matures into the market.  I am confident in maintaining acceptable quality on the lite version which will facilitate additional growth in the industrial market while improving the perceived / actual quality on the Real McCoy for hospitals.  Product differentiation a key driver in wanting to pursue the McCoy lite as it should allow us to sell two unique products to two different markets.

Customers of healthcare equipment fall into 3 categories. (A) Private hospitals, (B) Publicly subsidized facilities, & (C) Private organizations (i.e., NGOs).\r\n2.	The existing Real McCoy is a high-end piece of equipment used for general medicine. Given its price premium the end market is likely (A) private healthcare.

The McCoy Lite should be marketed towards (B) & (C) unlocking a new customer base. It will target the budgets of publicly subsidized facilities, NGOs, international aid groups to offset the risk of soft demand & reputational harm.

Servicing GMs are typically accretive at 40-50%.\r\na.	Extend the useful life of existing Real McCoy devices (repairs)\r\nb.	Support NGOs in the deployment, training, & maintenance of McCoy Lite. Strategic goal to establish a US Government contract to provide equipment & training to NGOs & aid groups (reliable cash flow).\r\n5.	McCoy Lite generates a higher NPV & IRR vs. the McCoy^2. Assumes 60% market share, $18k selling price, 34% CM, 117 net units of cannibalization over 6 years. This said, there are too many variables to decide on this alone. The prudent conclusions is that McCoy Lite is financially viable.\r\n',1652192181),(4396,2393,3001,21925,'Based on the data included in the BPM, the analysis shows insignificant variance in NPV ($32k) but a much better IRR (160% vs. 113%) and payback (3.3 vs. 4.1) for Lite than for McCoy2. Initial investment is $500k higher for McCoy2 and the CM is lower by $2,630k. Mkt expenses are $529k lower and the Real McCoy spillover is positive by $2,311k. Taxes and WC are also better for McCoy2. Based on IRR and payback, McCoy Lite seems to be the more interesting option. So, based on current analysis, McCoy Lite should be the second product.\r\nQuestions here are how flexible the prices are, how could we gain market share, how variable costs will change, how much mkt expenses are we expensing, etc. In my opinion, high-end products have more room to increase prices than commodities, so we could be able to increase McCoy2 prices but not McCoy Lite. If we increase prices $500k each quarter during the first 3 quarters, it will result in a better IRR for McCoy2. If we increase market share 1% each quarter during the first 3 quarters, assuming also an increase in mkt expenses, McCoy Lite would be the best option based on IRR and payback ratios. Based on the above, my decision is to choose McCoy Lite as a second product.\r\nThe main risk of McCoy Lite is the cannibalization of the core product. Even assuming a double percentage of cannibalization than the analysis the IRR and payback would still be better than McCoy2.\r\nWe also may consider reducing prices if the market does not respond as expected and we lose market share. And other incremental costs not included in the analysis.\r\nTo mitigate actions and to ensure market acceptance and growth, we have to assume the risks detected avoiding and/or controlling them establishing a follow-up assessment.

I do believe that longer term from an R&D standpoint, the company is getting ahead by doing their investment in the premium product now, that will eventually probably become the standard down the road.  \r\n\r\nI do think there is a benefit to be captured by Mccoy Lite from a cost standpoint on outsourcing, but I think given the fact we know that outsourcing is on the horizon once the FDA approves for the other McCoy products, we can manage that over the next 2 years.

This would allow our internal team to develop further products and focus on selling what we have in the marketplace. Getting the product in more end users hands and driving volume, we can cover our overhead easier and get the market acceptance of the product further along. This will give us an opportunity to step-up the product and drive desire to have a newer, more powerful unit in the future. We do risk cannibalizing more sales with the McCoy unit, however this is a risk that could pay off is wide acceptance becomes available. We also have supply chain risks from outsourcing to other vendors.

Real McCoy Lite also seems to have more room for market share growth, with 30% more total market size increase vs RM2. \r\n\r\nSupply Impact | We have 1 source of DPC through ATAT. While we have a good relationship with them, they are our the only supplier and can sometime send defective product.  They also are the supplier for all our competitors. McCoy Lite only requires 1 DPC while RM2 requires 3. I have concerns that we would be putting to much risk to the organization by indexing so heavily in our DPC supplier in the near term. Although demand will be higher for McCoy Lite, I\'d expect total need for DPC between RM + RML to be lower with the McCOy Lite path vs RM2 + RM.\r\n\r\nManufacturing | We have capacity constraints in our plants currently and it will take time to ramp to meet demand needs. However, with McCoy Lite we have optionality in outsourcing sooner then if we went with the more complicated RM2 product which would require 2 years of experience before outsourcing. This 2 year period I believe would be costly to serve internally, with plants already unable to service current demand and potentially allow our market share position to fall relative to competitors in a way that would be difficult to climb out of.  In additional, while we could leverage machine-based quality assurance - outsourcing could be a path to  mitigating the internal people-risk by still requiring QAA individuals to help stand up the outsourcing. ',1669141631),(5513,2702,3632,24990,'The RM2 provides access to important new neo-natal and cardiovascular health customers, allowing ABC2 to differentiate ourselves from and charge a premium price vs our competitors. By targeting higher end/lower volume markets, we can reduce variable labor expense, inventory, and ILM investment/maintenance as fewer units will be required to achieve revenue goals. Combined with higher prices, we can expand margins despite increased component expense and incremental investments in R&D, quality, and marketing. Quality (features and durability) will be key, so we must invest in both to be able to be successful with this strategy. It is imperative that we understand and address customer needs, so we should invest in market research and conduct customer conversations. ',1669147422),(5514,2702,3637,24990,'I recommend MEA focus our resources on procuring, producing and selling the Real McCoy^2 product. I believe that focusing our efforts on the higher margin product will generate increases profits for all stakeholders. \r\n\r\nA few key assumptions being made regarding this decisions is that we are able to lock in a supply agreement with ATAT Group to ensure supply chain disruptions are minimized, that our inventory carrying costs will not see significant increases and that an attempt at utilizing a 3rd party supplier for the McCoy Lite model will not be a significant benefit within the the short term 6 quarter window in terms of reduced product costs for the inital investment needed. I\'m also assuming that our current Real McCoy product will not be cannabolized and in fact demand will increase as our marketing efforts focused on our McCoy^2 will generate some interest in the current product as a more economical option.\r\n\r\nThere are also risks with this strategy, a large one is that our DPC supplier (ATAT Group) isn\'t able to provide the necessary DPC\'s to produce the higher end product. My focus would be on ensuring consistent supply even if that means paying a slightly higher price for do so. Another risk is that the market for the McCoy^2 doesn\'t bear out the 9% to 14% expected price premium for these products and we aren\'t able to achieve significantly better margins on these units versus the current model or the McCoy Lite after that product is able to be outsourced effectively. The McCoy^2 will not be able to penetrate as large of a market which does mean one risk is a competitors quickly filling the marketplace with similar units and the demand not growing as quick as projected for our product versus our competitors.
