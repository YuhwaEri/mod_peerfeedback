Employees will leave throughout the year regardless of the hours, pay and conditions. With the price of hiring a new employees costing $2,000, and laying someone off costing $4,000, employee turnover in the factory could be devastating. \nMitigation-\nTo help mitigate this turnover, we have worked closely with the employee committee to understand their concerns/ wants. In an effort to retain our work force, we have decided to promote from within, keep working and overtime hours reasonable with good pay, and not to rush into replacing our human workers with machines.  \n\nQuality Control:\nRisk-\nWith the Real McCoy being a medical product, accuracy and quality is necessary. We must be able to deliver the product that we are advertising. If there are issues with the product, it will come back to hurt both our brand, and our wallet. There is a penalty of $50,000 if our quality standards fall below 4.8 sigma.\nMitigation-\nIn an effort to maintain our high quality standards, we have decided to continue to hone our production process, continually improving. We have also explored options such as hiring more QAA employees, as well as purchasing more machines. \n\nMeeting customer demand volatility:\nRisk-\nThere is so much we can do with calculating forecast for our customers’ demand, and at times it can be very unpredictable. There can exist a lot of volatility in customer demand and it is difficult to predict in order to meet their demand and fulfill every order.\nMitigation-\nWe will analyze historical data on customer demand as well as take seasonality into consideration when predicting our customer demand. In order to be as prepared as possible we will calculate how much safety stock needs to be accounted for.\n\n\n',0,226,1539115581),(10,2586,'assignsubmission_comments','submission_comments',1677,'HI Brian,\n\nThank you for your warm welcome.

As a temporary replacement, John Smith from the IT organization will send an email with the most important information so you all can be aware of it. John will also be available through Skype if anything needs to be clarified or there are any other questions.\nAccording to the memo sent by John L. Lewis, the agreement was to increase hourly wages by 5%, and we will stick to that commitment as well as to the medical insurance commitment. \nAll information about the 401K and employee dress code is still being worked on by HR and unfortunately, I cannot give you a definitive response on it; however, we will provide an update at the end of the year.\nWe all look forward to meeting you to.

With the help of our employees and our tireless team, we believe we can reach these results by the end of this fiscal year. Once we are able to reach our profitability metrics, we can also ensure that the employees will not be required to pay additional charges for medical insurance – the company will cover that. Due to investment opportunities, much of our cash capital is being utilized to improve our capacity and efficiency, which will ultimately improve the working quality and conditions of our workers. \n\nAnother measure to ensure the working quality and conditions of our workers meets standard federal guidelines, our first priority is the safety of our workers. We will not implement a formal or strict dress code, but we will require that the employees where appropriate clothes for their safety in the factory (including close toed shoes, non-baggy clothing that can get caught in machinery, etc.)\n\nThank you for your continued support and engagement with the team.
