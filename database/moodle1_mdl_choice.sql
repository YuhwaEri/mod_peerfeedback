SPOC) has been calling and messaging Ramona about a packaging concern.&nbsp; This VP had tried to contact Bob Nelson, who she dealt with during the acquisition negotiations, but, as you may know, Nelson is no longer with us.</p><p>Apparently this packaging concern has been a long-standing issue that she has not able to get resolved. She did indicate that Nelson promised we would solve this for her as soon as we were up and running.</p><p>Our current packaging &nbsp;uses the standard ManX packaging material. The nub of the issue is that the Pure&amp;Clear™ poly 3000 material, a ManX standard that encases the air pillows used for packaging Real McCoys, is not biodegradable.&nbsp; There is a biodegradable substitute available, AirSeal 7™, from the same vendor, but&nbsp;<b>switching will add $2.00 per unit to your Other Material cost</b>.&nbsp; Your current packaging equipment will also require some minor modifications (<i>$</i><b>10,000 Program Expense number 2</b>).&nbsp;&nbsp; This VP did not indicate any willingness to adjust our transfer pricing if you choose to take on these additional costs.</p><p><b>This is your call.</b>&nbsp; We are not required to make this change and we certainly don’t want to open the door to a series of nickel and dime changes.&nbsp; And, we don’t want to take a profitability hit.&nbsp; However, we want a happy end customer.</p><p>Please let Ramona know how you will proceed.&nbsp; If you plan to change materials, let her know when.&nbsp; If you elect not to change, give her some words to use when she talks to this VP again.&nbsp; Ramona would prefer that you neither talk to this VP directly nor discuss this issue with your SPOC.</p><p>Please

I look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship.<br>&nbsp;<br>With all professional respect,<br>&nbsp;<br>Senior Ranke<strong><br></strong></span></h5>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1561487491,0,NULL),(565,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 9:30 AM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560947792,0,NULL),(566,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 10 AM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560947803,0,NULL),(567,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 5:15 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560946431,0,NULL),(568,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 5:45 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560946443,0,NULL),(569,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #3 - Due by 6:15 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560946454,0,NULL),(570,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 9:45 AM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560926640,0,NULL),(571,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 10:15 AM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560926727,0,NULL),(572,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #3 - Due by 10:45 AM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560926783,0,NULL),(573,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 4 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560787519,0,NULL),(574,1774,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 4:30 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1560787592,0,NULL),(575,14,'TEST Choice for Skills Matrix','<p>Please select your top 3 skills from the matrix below, or add other skills.</p>',1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1561507130,1,NULL),(576,1775,'Productivity Increase Opportunity - Statistical Sampling','<p></p><h5>MEMORANDUM FOR: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship.<br>&nbsp;<br>With all professional respect,<br>&nbsp;<br>Senior Ranke<strong><br></strong></span></h5>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1616619575,0,NULL),(1982,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 12:00 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766484,0,NULL),(1983,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 12:15 AM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766502,0,NULL),(1984,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 4:45 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766318,0,NULL),(1985,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due 5:15 PM  ','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766324,0,NULL),(1986,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 12:45 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766139,0,NULL),(1987,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 1:30 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618980728,0,NULL),(1988,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #3 - Due by 2:00 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766162,0,NULL),(1989,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 12:45 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766054,0,NULL),(1990,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 1:30 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766074,0,NULL),(1991,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #3 - Due by 2:00 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618766082,0,NULL),(1992,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 1:15 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618806800,0,NULL),(1993,2512,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 2:15 PM','<p></p><h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please </span>select the&nbsp;Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> you would like to discuss.</span></h5><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1618806812,0,NULL),(1994,2514,'7.

And if I seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot with anyone on your team, I profusely apologize.<br>&nbsp;<br>I want to correct all false impressions. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our first step was to put Stan Chipman in place as our West Cost Sales Rep, and your primary point of contact.&nbsp; But to further show our commitment to our relationship, we at Ranke Electronics would like to cordially invite your entire management team (of course with spouses or significant others) to cocktails and dinner at the very famous and exclusive Wooden Bridge restaurant in New York City, and from there to the Broadway show of your choosing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ranke will underwrite the dinner, arrange for all of the tickets and the necessary transportation from your individual homes to the city, to the restaurant, to the show, to a small after-theatre party at a surprise location, and then safely back to your homes. We promise the best food, the best wine, the best entertainment, and the most fun.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the course of this delightful evening we will have the opportunity to get to know each other much better, understand each other’s perspectives and expectations, and hopefully discuss the importance of extending our relationship beyond the exclusive contract that expires at the end of this year.<br>&nbsp;<br>Please let me know which show your group would like to see, the number of people in your group, and which weekend would be most convenient for your team. &nbsp;From our point of view, the sooner we move forward the better.

And if I seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot with anyone on your team, I profusely apologize.<br>&nbsp;<br>I want to correct all false impressions. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our first step was to put Stan Chipman in place as our West Cost Sales Rep, and your primary point of contact.&nbsp; But to further show our commitment to our relationship, we at Ranke Electronics would like to cordially invite your entire management team (of course with spouses or significant others) to cocktails and dinner at the very famous and exclusive Wooden Bridge restaurant in New York City, and from there to the Broadway show of your choosing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ranke will underwrite the dinner, arrange for all of the tickets and the necessary transportation from your individual homes to the city, to the restaurant, to the show, to a small after-theatre party at a surprise location, and then safely back to your homes. We promise the best food, the best wine, the best entertainment, and the most fun.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the course of this delightful evening we will have the opportunity to get to know each other much better, understand each other’s perspectives and expectations, and hopefully discuss the importance of extending our relationship beyond the exclusive contract that expires at the end of this year.<br>&nbsp;<br>Please let me know which show your group would like to see, the number of people in your group, and which weekend would be most convenient for your team. &nbsp;From our point of view, the sooner we move forward the better.

We will charge you <b>3.0%</b> of your sales for this work, irrespective of repair volume.&nbsp; &nbsp;The benefit for you is greater predictability of your warranty costs,&nbsp; which is notoriously difficult to forecast, and our benefit is locking your factory\'s repair work for the next 2 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 3% cap will increase with your sales level, but the increase will be linear with sales.<br></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As under our current agreement, we will expect payment in the quarter in which we do the work. Also, there will be no change in your rights to audit our quality and production volumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a long, productive, and mutually profitable relationship. If you wish to enter into this agreement, please identify that you ACCEPT the proposal.&nbsp; Should you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thank

us different truths, which shape our expectations as\r\nwell as those of our customers. We must integrate and standardize our existing systems to create “single sources of truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>The IT industry defines a “<b>single source of truth\"</b> as the\r\n\"one source [of data] that everyone in a company agrees is the real\r\ntrusted number for operating data.\" Business leaders seek to find the\r\none piece of data from their various applications that should be relied upon\r\nfor reporting on a particular variable of the business. </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>We\r\nneed to consolidate all sources into one meaningful data stream. This is long\r\noverdue.&nbsp; I estimate the <b>costs to be $175,000</b> to adapt our\r\nsystems to collect/manage this data.

To that end, Four Ring BioEngineering would like to cordially invite your entire management team (of course with spouses or significant others) to cocktails and dinner at the very famous and exclusive Wooden Bridge restaurant in New York City, and from there to the Broadway show of your choosing. &nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>FRB will underwrite the dinner, arrange all the tickets and the necessary transportation from your individual homes to the city, to the restaurant, to the show, to a small after-theatre party at a surprise location, and then safely back to your homes. We promise the best food, the best wine, the best entertainment, and the most fun.&nbsp; We can secure tickets for the following shows: <b><i>\"The Book of Mormon\",\"Funny Girl\", \"The Lion King\", \"Wicked\", \"Hamilton\" and \"Phantom of the Opera\".</i></b><br></p><p></p><p>Over the course of this delightful evening, we will have the opportunity to get to know each other much better, understand each other’s perspectives and expectations, and hopefully discuss the importance of extending our relationship beyond the exclusive contract that expires at the end of this year.<br></p><p></p><p>Please select which show your group would be most interested in, and in the comment box, identify the number of people in your group, and which weekend would be most convenient for your team.

D&amp;K will of course absorb all direct costs of this replacement.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this will require you to take your machines out of production for approximately ten days.&nbsp; Please let me know if you wish us to make the change this quarter or next.</p><p>You should note that, as specified in our lease agreement, UETM downtime required by technical advisories does not impact quarterly lease costs.&nbsp; Further, any Saturday work will continue to require the proportional lease cost increase specified in our agreement.<br></p><p><span><b>Please select a&nbsp; response through your LMS for when you would like this 10-day shutdown change in Q1 or Q2.&nbsp;</b><i style=\"\"> <span class=\"\" style=\"color: rgb(239, 69, 64);\">You can adjust your UETM co-bot output for the quarter by multiplying your current machine output (Row 65) by .85&nbsp; (55 days/65 days)</span></i></span></p><p><b>This must be submitted by the end of this quarter.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></b></p><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1666200449,0,NULL),(2688,2562,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 10:30 am','<h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please select the </span>Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">you would like to discuss.</span></h5>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1666307106,0,NULL),(2689,2562,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 11:15 am','<h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please select the </span>Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">you would like to discuss.</span></h5>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1666307111,0,NULL),(2690,2562,'2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap - OPS','<b>From:</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Clayton, Owner &amp; President DES<br><span style=\"\"><b>To: &nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Operations Manager&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Subject:&nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Sent:</b>&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thursday, October 1, 2022 11:12 AM</span><p><br>Congratulations on the acquisition of your new factories.&nbsp; DES provides warranty support for your Real McCoy and Real McCoy2 product lines.&nbsp; &nbsp; I has approached your prime customer six months ago about an offer to cap the warranty expense on the Real McCoy Scanner.&nbsp; They never responded, so I am extending this offer to you.<br></p><p>Warranty claims have been increasing each quarter.&nbsp; We are confident this is a function of your increasing volumes, and DES congratulates you on your success. We also want to assure you that we have more than sufficient capacity to meet your increasing needs.&nbsp; We are honored to be your partner and are committed to continuing to invest &amp; expand to meet your needs.</p><p>Our partnership has flourished over the last eighteen months of working together, and we would like to explore formalizing our partnership. <b>My following proposal is a real win-win.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My initial proposal is:</b><p>In return for an initial up-front payment of <b>$150,000</b>, we will repair all returned products (including any additions to your product line) for the next two years. We will charge you <b>3.0%</b> of your sales for this work, irrespective of repair volume.&nbsp; &nbsp;The benefit for you is greater predictability of your warranty costs,&nbsp; which is notoriously difficult to forecast, and our benefit is locking your factory\'s repair work for the next 2 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 3% cap will increase with your sales level, but the increase will be linear with sales.<br></p>\n\n<p>As under our current agreement, we will expect payment in the quarter in which we do the work. Also, there will be no change in your rights to audit our quality and production volumes.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a long, productive, and mutually profitable relationship. If you wish to enter into this agreement, please identify that you ACCEPT the proposal.&nbsp; Should you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thank

our expectations as\nwell as those of our customers. We must integrate and standardize our existing systems to create “single sources of truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>\n\n</p><p>The IT industry defines a “<b>single source of truth\"</b> as the\n\"one source [of data] that everyone in a company agrees is the real\ntrusted number for operating data.\" Business leaders seek to find the\none piece of data from their various applications that should be relied upon\nfor reporting on a particular variable of the business. </p><p>\n\n</p><p>We\nneed to consolidate all sources into one meaningful data stream. This is long\noverdue.&nbsp; I estimate the <b>costs to be $175,000</b> to adapt our\nsystems to collect/manage this data.

We promise the best food, the best wine, the best entertainment, and the most fun.&nbsp; We can secure tickets for the following shows: <b><i>\"The Book of Mormon\",\"Funny Girl\", \"The Lion King\", \"Wicked\", \"Hamilton\" and \"Phantom of the Opera\".</i></b><br></p><p></p><p>Over the course of this delightful evening, we will have the opportunity to get to know each other much better, understand each other’s perspectives and expectations, and hopefully discuss the importance of extending our relationship beyond the exclusive contract that expires at the end of this year.<br></p><p></p><p>Please select which show your group would be most interested in, and in the comment box, identify the number of people in your group, and which weekend would be most convenient for your team.

D&amp;K will of course absorb all direct costs of this replacement.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this will require you to take your machines out of production for approximately ten days.&nbsp; Please let me know if you wish us to make the change this quarter or next.</p><p>You should note that, as specified in our lease agreement, UETM downtime required by technical advisories does not impact quarterly lease costs.&nbsp; Further, any Saturday work will continue to require the proportional lease cost increase specified in our agreement.<br></p><p><span><b>Please select a&nbsp; response through your LMS for when you would like this 10-day shutdown change in Q1 or Q2.&nbsp;</b><i style=\"\"> <span class=\"\" style=\"color: rgb(239, 69, 64);\">You can adjust your UETM co-bot output for the quarter by multiplying your current machine output (Row 65) by .85&nbsp; (55 days/65 days)</span></i></span></p><p><b>This must be submitted by the end of this quarter.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></b></p><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1666200449,0,NULL),(2742,2564,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 4:15 pm / 8:15 am','<h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please select the </span>Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">you would like to discuss.</span></h5>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1668754503,0,NULL),(2743,2564,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 5:15 pm / 9:15 am','<h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please select the </span>Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">you would like to discuss.</span></h5>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1668754488,0,NULL),(2744,2564,'2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap - OPS','<b>From:</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Clayton, Owner &amp; President DES<br><span style=\"\"><b>To: &nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Operations Manager&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Subject:&nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Sent:</b>&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thursday, October 1, 2022 11:12 AM</span><p><br>Congratulations on the acquisition of your new factories.&nbsp; DES provides warranty support for your Real McCoy and Real McCoy2 product lines.&nbsp; &nbsp; I has approached your prime customer six months ago about an offer to cap the warranty expense on the Real McCoy Scanner.&nbsp; They never responded, so I am extending this offer to you.<br></p><p>Warranty claims have been increasing each quarter.&nbsp; We are confident this is a function of your increasing volumes, and DES congratulates you on your success. We also want to assure you that we have more than sufficient capacity to meet your increasing needs.&nbsp; We are honored to be your partner and are committed to continuing to invest &amp; expand to meet your needs.</p><p>Our partnership has flourished over the last eighteen months of working together, and we would like to explore formalizing our partnership. <b>My following proposal is a real win-win.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My initial proposal is:</b><p>In return for an initial up-front payment of <b>$150,000</b>, we will repair all returned products (including any additions to your product line) for the next two years. We will charge you <b>3.0%</b> of your sales for this work, irrespective of repair volume.&nbsp; &nbsp;The benefit for you is greater predictability of your warranty costs,&nbsp; which is notoriously difficult to forecast, and our benefit is locking your factory\'s repair work for the next 2 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 3% cap will increase with your sales level, but the increase will be linear with sales.<br></p>\n\n<p>As under our current agreement, we will expect payment in the quarter in which we do the work. Also, there will be no change in your rights to audit our quality and production volumes.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a long, productive, and mutually profitable relationship. If you wish to enter into this agreement, please identify that you ACCEPT the proposal.&nbsp; Should you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thank

added your factory operations to ManX, we decided to keep your factory systems intact.&nbsp; Now we have many multiple sources of data, such\nas our HR databases, our manufacturing equipment (ILM robots &amp; UETM cobots), and FDA quality audit databases, just to name a few.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of these sources have different measures &amp;\ndifferent views, giving us different truths, which shape our expectations as\nwell as those of our customers. We must integrate and standardize our existing systems to create “single sources of truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>\n\n</p><p>The IT industry defines a “<b>single source of truth\"</b> as the\n\"one source [of data] that everyone in a company agrees is the real\ntrusted number for operating data.\" Business leaders seek to find the\none piece of data from their various applications that should be relied upon\nfor reporting on a particular variable of the business. </p><p>\n\n</p><p>We\nneed to consolidate all sources into one meaningful data stream. This is long\noverdue.&nbsp; I estimate the <b>costs to be $175,000</b> to adapt our\nsystems to collect/manage this data.

FENCES</b></p>\n\n<p>I\nunderstand that the prior managers of your company had some hard, and maybe\nsome bad, feelings about me.&nbsp; Some of the\nnicer adjectives I heard were recalcitrant, pig-headed, greedy, and the\nlike.&nbsp; I want to assure you that that <u>is\nnot</u> the Gabriel Varden that you are dealing with.&nbsp; And if I seem to have gotten off on the wrong\nfoot with anyone on your team, I profusely apologize.</p><p>I want\nto correct all false impressions.&nbsp; To\nthat end Four Ring BioEngineering would like to cordially invite your entire\nmanagement team (of course with spouses or significant others) to cocktails and\ndinner at the very famous and exclusive Wooden Bridge restaurant in New York\nCity and from there, to the Broadway Play of your choosing.&nbsp; (We have access to tickets for <b>Hamilton</b>, <b>Wicked</b>, and <b>The Lion King</b>!)&nbsp; &nbsp;FRB will underwrite the dinner, arrange for\nall of the tickets and the necessary transportation from your individual homes\nto the city, to the restaurant, to the play, to a small after-theatre party at\na surprise location, and then safely back to your homes.&nbsp; We promise the best food, the best wine, the\nbest entertainment, and the most fun.</p>\n\n<p>In the\ncourse of this delightful evening, we will get an opportunity to know each other\nmuch better, understand each other’s perspectives and expectations, and\nhopefully discuss the importance of extending our relationship beyond the\nexclusive contract that expires at the end of this year.</p>\n\n<p>Please\nlet me know the play your group would be most interested in, the number of\npeople in your group, and which weekend would be most convenient for your\nteam.&nbsp; From our point of view, the sooner\nwe move forward, the better.&nbsp; I look\nforward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;With\nall professional

To that end, Four Ring BioEngineering would like to cordially invite your entire management team (of course with spouses or significant others) to cocktails and dinner at the very famous and exclusive Wooden Bridge restaurant in New York City, and from there to the Broadway show of your choosing. &nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>FRB will underwrite the dinner, arrange all the tickets and the necessary transportation from your individual homes to the city, to the restaurant, to the show, to a small after-theatre party at a surprise location, and then safely back to your homes. We promise the best food, the best wine, the best entertainment, and the most fun.&nbsp; We can secure tickets for the following shows: <b><i>\"The Book of Mormon\",\"Funny Girl\", \"The Lion King\", \"Wicked\", \"Hamilton\" and \"Phantom of the Opera\".</i></b><br></p><p></p><p>Over the course of this delightful evening, we will have the opportunity to get to know each other much better, understand each other’s perspectives and expectations, and hopefully discuss the importance of extending our relationship beyond the exclusive contract that expires at the end of this year.<br></p><p></p><p>Please select which show your group would be most interested in, and in the comment box, identify the number of people in your group, and which weekend would be most convenient for your team.

D&amp;K will of course absorb all direct costs of this replacement.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this will require you to take your machines out of production for approximately ten days.&nbsp; Please let me know if you wish us to make the change this quarter or next.</p><p>You should note that, as specified in our lease agreement, UETM downtime required by technical advisories does not impact quarterly lease costs.&nbsp; Further, any Saturday work will continue to require the proportional lease cost increase specified in our agreement.<br></p><p><span><b>Please select a&nbsp; response through your LMS for when you would like this 10-day shutdown change in Q1 or Q2.&nbsp;</b><i style=\"\"> <span class=\"\" style=\"color: rgb(239, 69, 64);\">You can adjust your UETM co-bot output for the quarter by multiplying your current machine output (Row 65) by .85&nbsp; (55 days/65 days)</span></i></span></p><p><b>This must be submitted by the end of this quarter.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></b></p><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1666200449,0,NULL),(2806,2567,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1','<p><b>FIRST ROLE PLAY SELECTION DUE NO LATER THAN:</b></p><p></p><p><b></b></p>China, Malaysia, Singapore &amp; Taiwan&nbsp;<b>11:45</b><br>India&nbsp;<b>09:15</b><br>Ukraine <b>05:45</b>&nbsp;',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1670785631,0,NULL),(2807,2567,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2','<p><b>SECOND ROLE PLAY SELECTION DUE NO LATER THAN:</b></p><p></p><p><b></b></p>China, Malaysia, Singapore &amp; Taiwan&nbsp;<b>12:15</b><br>India&nbsp;<b>09:45</b><br>Ukraine&nbsp;<b>06</b><b>:15</b>&nbsp;',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1670785554,0,NULL),(2808,2567,'2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap - OPS','<b>From:</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Clayton, Owner &amp; President DES<br><span style=\"\"><b>To: &nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Operations Manager&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Subject:&nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Sent:</b>&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thursday, October 1, 2022 11:12 AM</span><p><br>Congratulations on the acquisition of your new factories.&nbsp; DES provides warranty support for your Real McCoy and Real McCoy2 product lines.&nbsp; &nbsp; I has approached your prime customer six months ago about an offer to cap the warranty expense on the Real McCoy Scanner.&nbsp; They never responded, so I am extending this offer to you.<br></p><p>Warranty claims have been increasing each quarter.&nbsp; We are confident this is a function of your increasing volumes, and DES congratulates you on your success. We also want to assure you that we have more than sufficient capacity to meet your increasing needs.&nbsp; We are honored to be your partner and are committed to continuing to invest &amp; expand to meet your needs.</p><p>Our partnership has flourished over the last eighteen months of working together, and we would like to explore formalizing our partnership. <b>My following proposal is a real win-win.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My initial proposal is:</b><p>In return for an initial up-front payment of <b>$150,000</b>, we will repair all returned products (including any additions to your product line) for the next two years. We will charge you <b>3.0%</b> of your sales for this work, irrespective of repair volume.&nbsp; &nbsp;The benefit for you is greater predictability of your warranty costs,&nbsp; which is notoriously difficult to forecast, and our benefit is locking your factory\'s repair work for the next 2 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 3% cap will increase with your sales level, but the increase will be linear with sales.<br></p>\n\n<p>As under our current agreement, we will expect payment in the quarter in which we do the work. Also, there will be no change in your rights to audit our quality and production volumes.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a long, productive, and mutually profitable relationship. If you wish to enter into this agreement, please identify that you ACCEPT the proposal.&nbsp; Should you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thank

added your factory operations to ManX, we decided to keep your factory systems intact.&nbsp; Now we have many multiple sources of data, such\nas our HR databases, our manufacturing equipment (ILM robots &amp; UETM cobots), and FDA quality audit databases, just to name a few.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of these sources have different measures &amp;\ndifferent views, giving us different truths, which shape our expectations as\nwell as those of our customers. We must integrate and standardize our existing systems to create “single sources of truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>\n\n</p><p>The IT industry defines a “<b>single source of truth\"</b> as the\n\"one source [of data] that everyone in a company agrees is the real\ntrusted number for operating data.\" Business leaders seek to find the\none piece of data from their various applications that should be relied upon\nfor reporting on a particular variable of the business. </p><p>\n\n</p><p>We\nneed to consolidate all sources into one meaningful data stream. This is long\noverdue.&nbsp; I estimate the <b>costs to be $175,000</b> to adapt our\nsystems to collect/manage this data. This will give us a <b>positive impact on our quality of .5 sigma improvement</b> and a <b>productivity gain of 3% on manual\ninspection</b>.<br></p><p>\n\n</p><p>Give\nthis serious thought.

We promise the best food, the best wine, the best entertainment, and the most fun.&nbsp; We can secure tickets for the following shows: <b><i>\"The Book of Mormon\",\"Funny Girl\", \"The Lion King\", \"Wicked\", \"Hamilton\" and \"Phantom of the Opera\".</i></b><br></p><p></p><p>Over the course of this delightful evening, we will have the opportunity to get to know each other much better, understand each other’s perspectives and expectations, and hopefully discuss the importance of extending our relationship beyond the exclusive contract that expires at the end of this year.<br></p><p></p><p>Please select which show your group would be most interested in, and in the comment box, identify the number of people in your group, and which weekend would be most convenient for your team.

D&amp;K will of course absorb all direct costs of this replacement.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this will require you to take your machines out of production for approximately ten days.&nbsp; Please let me know if you wish us to make the change this quarter or next.</p><p>You should note that, as specified in our lease agreement, UETM downtime required by technical advisories does not impact quarterly lease costs.&nbsp; Further, any Saturday work will continue to require the proportional lease cost increase specified in our agreement.<br></p><p><span><b>Please select a&nbsp; response through your LMS for when you would like this 10-day shutdown change in Q1 or Q2.&nbsp;</b><i style=\"\"> <span class=\"\" style=\"color: rgb(239, 69, 64);\">You can adjust your UETM co-bot output for the quarter by multiplying your current machine output (Row 65) by .85&nbsp; (55 days/65 days)</span></i></span></p><p><b>This must be submitted by the end of this quarter.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></b></p><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1666200449,0,NULL),(2823,2569,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 - Due by 10:30 am ','<h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please select the </span>Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">you would like to discuss.</span></h5>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1673215051,0,NULL),(2824,2569,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 - Due by 11:30 am','<h5><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Please select the </span>Role Play character<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">, and </span>enter the topic <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">you would like to discuss.</span></h5>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1673215098,0,NULL),(2825,2569,'2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap - OPS','<b>From:</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Clayton, Owner &amp; President DES<br><span style=\"\"><b>To: &nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Operations Manager&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Subject:&nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Sent:</b>&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thursday, October 1, 2022 11:12 AM</span><p><br>Congratulations on the acquisition of your new factories.&nbsp; DES provides warranty support for your Real McCoy and Real McCoy2 product lines.&nbsp; &nbsp; I has approached your prime customer six months ago about an offer to cap the warranty expense on the Real McCoy Scanner.&nbsp; They never responded, so I am extending this offer to you.<br></p><p>Warranty claims have been increasing each quarter.&nbsp; We are confident this is a function of your increasing volumes, and DES congratulates you on your success. We also want to assure you that we have more than sufficient capacity to meet your increasing needs.&nbsp; We are honored to be your partner and are committed to continuing to invest &amp; expand to meet your needs.</p><p>Our partnership has flourished over the last eighteen months of working together, and we would like to explore formalizing our partnership. <b>My following proposal is a real win-win.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My initial proposal is:</b><p>In return for an initial up-front payment of <b>$150,000</b>, we will repair all returned products (including any additions to your product line) for the next two years. We will charge you <b>3.0%</b> of your sales for this work, irrespective of repair volume.&nbsp; &nbsp;The benefit for you is greater predictability of your warranty costs,&nbsp; which is notoriously difficult to forecast, and our benefit is locking your factory\'s repair work for the next 2 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 3% cap will increase with your sales level, but the increase will be linear with sales.<br></p>\n\n<p>As under our current agreement, we will expect payment in the quarter in which we do the work. Also, there will be no change in your rights to audit our quality and production volumes.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a long, productive, and mutually profitable relationship. If you wish to enter into this agreement, please identify that you ACCEPT the proposal.&nbsp; Should you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thank

added your factory operations to ManX, we decided to keep your factory systems intact.&nbsp; Now we have many multiple sources of data, such\nas our HR databases, our manufacturing equipment (ILM robots &amp; UETM cobots), and FDA quality audit databases, just to name a few.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of these sources have different measures &amp;\ndifferent views, giving us different truths, which shape our expectations as\nwell as those of our customers. We must integrate and standardize our existing systems to create “single sources of truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>\n\n</p><p>The IT industry defines a “<b>single source of truth\"</b> as the\n\"one source [of data] that everyone in a company agrees is the real\ntrusted number for operating data.\" Business leaders seek to find the\none piece of data from their various applications that should be relied upon\nfor reporting on a particular variable of the business. </p><p>\n\n</p><p>We\nneed to consolidate all sources into one meaningful data stream. This is long\noverdue.&nbsp; I estimate the <b>costs to be $175,000</b> to adapt our\nsystems to collect/manage this data. This will give us a <b>positive impact on our quality of .5 sigma improvement</b> and a <b>productivity gain of 3% on manual\ninspection</b>.<br></p><p>\n\n</p><p>Give\nthis serious thought.

We promise the best food, the best wine, the best entertainment, and the most fun.&nbsp; We can secure tickets for the following shows: <b><i>\"The Book of Mormon\",\"Funny Girl\", \"The Lion King\", \"Wicked\", \"Hamilton\" and \"Phantom of the Opera\".</i></b><br></p><p></p><p>Over the course of this delightful evening, we will have the opportunity to get to know each other much better, understand each other’s perspectives and expectations, and hopefully discuss the importance of extending our relationship beyond the exclusive contract that expires at the end of this year.<br></p><p></p><p>Please select which show your group would be most interested in, and in the comment box, identify the number of people in your group, and which weekend would be most convenient for your team.

D&amp;K will of course absorb all direct costs of this replacement.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this will require you to take your machines out of production for approximately ten days.&nbsp; Please let me know if you wish us to make the change this quarter or next.</p><p>You should note that, as specified in our lease agreement, UETM downtime required by technical advisories does not impact quarterly lease costs.&nbsp; Further, any Saturday work will continue to require the proportional lease cost increase specified in our agreement.<br></p><p><span><b>Please select a&nbsp; response through your LMS for when you would like this 10-day shutdown change in Q1 or Q2.&nbsp;</b><i style=\"\"> <span class=\"\" style=\"color: rgb(239, 69, 64);\">You can adjust your UETM co-bot output for the quarter by multiplying your current machine output (Row 65) by .85&nbsp; (55 days/65 days)</span></i></span></p><p><b>This must be submitted by the end of this quarter.&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245); font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, &quot;Courier New&quot;, monospace; white-space: pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></b></p><br><p></p>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1666200449,0,NULL),(2858,2571,'ROLE PLAY CALL #1 ','<p><b>FIRST ROLE PLAY SELECTION DUE NO LATER THAN:</b><br></p><p><span><span>CET 9:45 AM</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>GMT 8:45 AM</span></span></p><p><span><span>HKT 16:45 PM</span></span></p><p><span><span>EST 3:45 AM</span></span></p><p><span><span>PST 12:45 AM</span></span></p>',1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1675719757,0,NULL),(2859,2571,'ROLE PLAY CALL #2 ','<p><b>SECOND ROLE PLAY SELECTION DUE NO LATER THAN:</b></p><p><span>CET 10:30 AM</span><br></p><p><span>GMT 9:30 AM</span></p><p><span>HKT 17:30 PM</span></p><p><span>EST 4:30 AM</span></p><p><span>PST 1:30 AM</span></p>',1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1675719650,0,NULL),(2860,2571,'2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap - OPS','<b>From:</b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia Clayton, Owner &amp; President DES<br><span style=\"\"><b>To: &nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Operations Manager&nbsp;<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Subject:&nbsp;</b></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal;\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.4.2 Warranty Cost Cap<br></span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>Sent:</b>&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thursday, October 1, 2022 11:12 AM</span><p><br>Congratulations on the acquisition of your new factories.&nbsp; DES provides warranty support for your Real McCoy and Real McCoy2 product lines.&nbsp; &nbsp; I has approached your prime customer six months ago about an offer to cap the warranty expense on the Real McCoy Scanner.&nbsp; They never responded, so I am extending this offer to you.<br></p><p>Warranty claims have been increasing each quarter.&nbsp; We are confident this is a function of your increasing volumes, and DES congratulates you on your success. We also want to assure you that we have more than sufficient capacity to meet your increasing needs.&nbsp; We are honored to be your partner and are committed to continuing to invest &amp; expand to meet your needs.</p><p>Our partnership has flourished over the last eighteen months of working together, and we would like to explore formalizing our partnership. <b>My following proposal is a real win-win.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>My initial proposal is:</b><p>In return for an initial up-front payment of <b>$150,000</b>, we will repair all returned products (including any additions to your product line) for the next two years. We will charge you <b>3.0%</b> of your sales for this work, irrespective of repair volume.&nbsp; &nbsp;The benefit for you is greater predictability of your warranty costs,&nbsp; which is notoriously difficult to forecast, and our benefit is locking your factory\'s repair work for the next 2 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The 3% cap will increase with your sales level, but the increase will be linear with sales.<br></p>\n\n<p>As under our current agreement, we will expect payment in the quarter in which we do the work. Also, there will be no change in your rights to audit our quality and production volumes.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate your consideration and look forward to a long, productive, and mutually profitable relationship. If you wish to enter into this agreement, please identify that you ACCEPT the proposal.&nbsp; Should you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thank

us different truths, which shape our expectations as\r\nwell as those of our customers. We must integrate and standardize our existing systems to create “single sources of truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>The IT industry defines a “<b>single source of truth\"</b> as the\r\n\"one source [of data] that everyone in a company agrees is the real\r\ntrusted number for operating data.\" Business leaders seek to find the\r\none piece of data from their various applications that should be relied upon\r\nfor reporting on a particular variable of the business. </p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>We\r\nneed to consolidate all sources into one meaningful data stream.
